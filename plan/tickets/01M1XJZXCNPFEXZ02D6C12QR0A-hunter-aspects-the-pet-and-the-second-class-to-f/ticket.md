Lands with item 54 or after it, because it takes the no-file proof away.

Two new readers. `buff` matches a list of names against `UnitAura("player")`
and reports the first that is up, with the client's own icon and expiry;
item 57 needs it too. `pet` answers `UnitExists("pet")` with the pet's name
and portrait and no clock; item 59 needs it. `UnitAura` is stubbed at
`scripts/harness/client/03-player.lua:205`; `UnitCreatureFamily`,
`GetPetHappiness` and a pet unit in the roster are not there at all.

`standing` is two slots, aspect and pet, `word = "aspects"`. The aspect slot
carries Hawk, Monkey, Cheetah, Pack, Wild, Beast and Viper and lights
whichever is up, because the question is which and not whether. The pet slot
is dark when the pet is dead or dismissed.

`reactive` is the finding: Mongoose Bite opens on a dodge and Counterattack
on a parry, which is Overpower and Revenge with the names swapped, and
`src/Buttons/Reaction.lua` already owns the parse. Confirm the window
against the warrior's five seconds; the two may not share it.

No `charge`, `forms`, `swing`, `requires` or `upkeep`. Every `requires`
candidate here is a range or aim rule the client already answers, and the
aspect is on the row above.

`suggested`: Hunter's Mark, Serpent Sting, Viper Sting, Scorpid Sting,
Wyvern Sting, Concussive Shot, Wing Clip, Scatter Shot, Silencing Shot,
Intimidation, Freezing Trap, Explosive Trap.
