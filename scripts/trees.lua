-- The addon is one namespace. Every file writes what it owns into `ns` and
-- reaches everything else through the same table, which means nothing in the
-- language stops Mail from calling into Bags or Character from calling into
-- Buttons. The architecture that says it should not was a sentence in a comment
-- in Core/Piles.lua, and a sentence is not a gate: by the time this file was
-- written there were thirty edges crossing trees that nobody had decided on.
--
-- One of them is worth naming because it is the whole argument. The mail window
-- wanted an item grid; the grid was parked in Bags because bags needed it first;
-- so Mail/Bags.lua names ns.BagsGrid. Nobody chose that. What should have
-- happened is that the grid moved to UI where both windows could see it, and the
-- only thing that would have forced the question is a gate refusing the shortcut.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The base
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The six trees a feature may name freely, and they are not a preference. A
-- base tree is one that many trees depend on and that depends on nothing
-- outside the base, and both halves are measured. Run with TREES_REPORT=1 for
-- the table this was read off:
--
--   Core   32 trees name it, and it names UI and Class
--   UI     32 trees name it, and it names Ck, Perf and Unit
--   Unit   13 trees name it, and it names nothing at all
--   Class  10 trees name it, and it names Unit
--   Perf    9 trees name it, and it names Core and UI
--   Ck      4 trees name it, and it names UI
--
-- UnitFrames used to look like base on in-degree alone and was not. Eight of its
-- nine callers wanted ns.BlizzHide, a switchboard over Core/Attic.lua that
-- landed in UnitFrames because unit frames asked for it first, and every other
-- tree then had to name UnitFrames to hide a frame that had nothing to do with
-- unit frames. It is Core/BlizzHide.lua now and those eight edges are gone.
-- The move is what this gate is for: the fix for a service in the wrong tree is
-- to move the file, never to write eight entries excusing the callers.
--
-- Buttons is the case still open. It is named by six trees while naming six
-- itself, which is a hub rather than a floor, and calling one base would exempt
-- every edge into it including the ones worth refusing.
--
-- Marking is the other side of the same test. It is a service by shape and
-- exactly one tree has ever asked it anything, so it stays a feature and that
-- one edge is written down below where it can be read.
local BASE = {
	Core = true, UI = true, Ck = true, Class = true, Unit = true, Perf = true,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The exemptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Every edge that crosses trees today, with the number of times it is named and
-- why it is allowed. Three rules hold this list honest, and they are the rules
-- scripts/shape.lua's list keeps, for the same reasons.
--
-- An entry needs a reason. An edge nobody explained is the invisible debt this
-- file exists to make visible, so a missing `why` fails like a violation.
--
-- An entry ratchets, in both directions and by two files. An edge named fewer
-- times than its entry claims fails here until the number comes down, so
-- deleting a call cannot be spent quietly on room to add another. A number that
-- goes up fails in scripts/ratchet.lua, which reads the committed copy of this
-- file and refuses the edit that raises a ceiling to meet the code that just
-- broke it.
--
-- An entry that matches nothing fails. An edge removed leaves its entry behind,
-- and an allow-list full of permissions for code that no longer exists is a list
-- nobody can read as a work list.
--
-- Read as a work list, the entries fall into four kinds.
--
-- A service in the wrong tree. ns.BlizzHide answers one question for the whole
-- addon and eight trees ask it; ns.Castable answers whether a spell is ready
-- and three do. Neither is a fact about the tree it lives in. These come off
-- the list by moving the file, not by editing the code that calls it.
--
-- A window naming another window's widget. Mail -> Bags and Bags -> Mail are
-- the pair, and they point at a grid that belongs in UI. Settings -> Character
-- is the same shape one layer up.
--
-- Two features that genuinely are one feature. Hover and Buttons name each
-- other because a key that casts on what the mouse is over is a binding on a
-- bar square; there is no version of that where one of them does not know
-- about the other. This kind is what an allow-list is actually for.
--
-- A feature reading another feature's data. Map -> Quests, UnitFrames ->
-- Quests, Mail -> Feeds. These are honest dependencies between things that are
-- separately useful, and the entry is the documentation.
