-- Which way the numbers in the gates are allowed to move.
--
-- scripts/shape.lua and scripts/check.sh both hold ceilings, and both say in
-- their own comments that those ceilings are ratchets: a number sits at what
-- the code measures today, an improvement lowers it in the same commit, and
-- growth fails rather than passing unremarked. Both enforce half of that. A
-- function that measures under its own entry fails until the entry comes down,
-- so an improvement cannot be spent quietly on room to grow again. Nothing
-- enforced the other half. A function that grew past its entry could have the
-- entry edited upward instead, and every scan went green.
--
-- That is not hypothetical and it is not rare. The header of shape.lua says the
-- per-file line ceiling was replaced because "one change hit the ceiling and
-- raised the number", and `59b36ce` then raised BarsWord from 97 lines and 37
-- branches to 101 and 38, inside the file that tells the story. A ceiling that
-- can be raised by the change it blocks is not a gate, it is a formality.
--
-- A raise is only visible against history, so this reads the committed copy of
-- each watched file and compares it to the one on disk:
--
--   lua5.1 scripts/ratchet.lua <label> <committed> <working>
--
-- Prints one line per number that went up and exits 1 if there were any.
--
-- Three moves stay legal. Lowering a number is the point. Deleting an entry is
-- an exemption given back. Adding one is a function or a file that did not
-- exist on the list before, and the check that belongs to a new entry belongs to
-- the file that holds it: shape.lua refuses an entry with no reason written on
-- it, and check.sh refuses one that names no file, carries no reason or claims a
-- marker the code does not have. The move this refuses is the one that reads as
-- progress and is not: the same key, higher.
--
-- Deleting an entry and re-adding it higher is the obvious way around, and it
-- does not work. The commit that deletes it leaves a function over the gate
-- with no exemption, and shape.lua fails on that before this ever runs.
