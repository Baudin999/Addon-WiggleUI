# The shelf is a page of cards, one per dungeon, and a card wants a picture of
# the place. Retail draws that out of the Encounter Journal's art, which the 2.5
# client does not ship: there is no interface/encounterjournal folder in its
# manifest at all. It does ship every instance's loading screen, which is a
# painting of the same place by the same artists, so that is what a card wears.
#
# Three exports, and every one of them is Blizzard's own table:
#
#   map.csv       the 2.5 client's instance list, which says which maps are five
#                 mans and which loading screen each carries.
#   screens.csv   LoadingScreens, which turns that id into a file id.
#   files.csv     ManifestInterfaceData, filtered to the loading screen folder,
#                 which turns a file id into the path it is drawn by.
#
# They come from wago.tools, which serves Blizzard's tables per build. This is
# not a dependency of the addon and is not needed to run it. It is needed to run
# this, once, when the dungeon list changes.
