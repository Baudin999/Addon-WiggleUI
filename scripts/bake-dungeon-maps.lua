-- Bakes src/Dungeons/Sheets.lua out of Blizzard's own map tables.
--
--   lua5.1 scripts/bake-dungeon-maps.lua <path to a folder of wago.tools exports>
--
-- Run through scripts/bake-dungeon-maps.sh, which fetches the exports and
-- checks the result.
--
-- **Why there is a baked file at all.** Every other picture in this addon is
-- asked for: UI/Chart.lua hands C_Map a zone and gets back the size of the art
-- and the tiles it is cut into, and Map/Window.lua draws whatever comes out.
-- Ask the same thing about a dungeon on either of these two clients and the
-- answer is nothing, and it is nothing for two different reasons.
--
-- The 1.15 client has no dungeon maps in its map tree. Its UiMap table is
-- fifty four rows: a world, six continents, sixty five zones and three
-- battlegrounds, and not one node of the dungeon kind. There is nothing there
-- to ask about.
--
-- The 2.5 client has a hundred and four of them, with the right names and the
-- right parents, and files no art for a single one. Its UiMapXMapArt table has
-- seventy three rows and every one of them is a zone or a continent, so
-- GetMapArtLayers answers nothing for every dungeon in the game. It has no
-- UiMapGroupMember table either, so GetMapGroupID cannot say that the
-- Deadmines and Ironclad Cove are two floors of one place.
--
-- **The pictures are there.** Both clients ship the tiles themselves as
-- ordinary textures, twelve to a floor, under Interface\WorldMap. Nothing in
-- the client's own data points at them any more, which is why C_Map will not
-- hand them over, but a texture is drawn by path and a path still resolves.
-- That is what this file bakes: the path, the floors it is cut into, and the
-- map id each floor answers to so a mark can land on it.
--
-- **Everything here is generated.** The tiles come from Blizzard's UiMapArtTile
-- keyed through UiMapXMapArt, the floor names and their order from
-- UiMapGroupMember, the map ids and their names from the 2.5 client's own
-- UiMap, and every path is checked against the community listfile before it is
-- written. A path that does not resolve draws nothing at all and says nothing
-- about it, so a path nobody checked is a blank rectangle waiting to happen.
--
-- The editorial half is three lines long and it is the names, below.

--
-- The book calls a place what a player calls it, and twice that is not what
-- the client calls it.
--
-- Blackrock Spire is one place to the client and two runs to everybody else,
-- the way Scarlet Monastery is one place and four wings. The book splits it
-- and the split has no colon in it, because nobody says "Blackrock Spire:
-- Lower".
--
-- Scholomance is the client's own scar. Cataclysm replaced the instance and
-- the old map was left in the table under a name with OLD stuck on the end,
-- which is the name the 2.5 client still carries.
