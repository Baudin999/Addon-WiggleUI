# Bakes src/Core/Shipped.lua out of an install's saved variables, so that the

# An addon cannot write files and saved variables live in WTF, which is per
# install and does not travel, so the layout goes out through saved variables
# and comes back in here as a file a git clone carries with it. bake-ui.sh does
# the same trick for Blizzard's own Edit Mode layout; this one is the addon's
# own settings.
#
# Two files are read. The account's holds the screen: where the windows sit and
# every switch and number that is not somebody's character. The character's
# holds the handful that live on one, and only the scalars among them come
# across, because every table under a character names spells that character has.
# Which character is the one that played most recently, or CHARACTER=<name>.
#
# Only settings are carried. The gold ledger, the drop counts, the groups and
# every other record the reset keeps are stepped over in bake-defaults.lua,
# which asks the addon which is which rather than keeping a list of its own.
