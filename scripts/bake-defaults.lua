-- entry as "the plan". Shipping the overrides would say every bar on a fresh
-- install has been dragged, leave `bars where` printing "(dragged)" against a
-- position nobody has touched, and turn the button that puts the bars back to
-- the plan into a button that puts them back to a capture of somebody else's.
--
-- A bar layout that should ship goes in the plan instead, which is what
-- `/wk bars where` prints it in the shape of.
--
-- The fourth is not an override but a number the client owns. barsDistance is
-- how far out a nameplate goes up, and UnitFrames\\Plates.lua asks the client
-- for its ceiling and writes the setting back down to it at every apply. A
-- capture taken in a session where the CVar would not answer carries whatever
-- was typed against that wall, and shipping it would ship a default the addon
-- corrects on the first frame and a reset that never lands on itself.
