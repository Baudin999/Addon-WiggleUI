# Every write on a ticker path is guarded against the value already on the
# frame.
#
# This is the defect that made the addon feel sluggish, and it is invisible in
# review because each instance looks harmless. A SetText or a SetColorTexture
# costs a measure and a relayout whether or not the value changed. A guard
# costs one comparison. At four tickers, fifteen nameplates and five ticks a
# second, the difference was about two thousand pointless widget writes every
# second.
#
# HOT lists the functions reachable from an OnUpdate. A banned write inside one
# of them fails unless an if, elseif or else stands between it and the top of
# the function. A for loop is not a guard: it repeats the write, it does not
# decide it.
#
# The same scan bans allocation on those paths, for the same reason one step
# further out. A table constructor or an anonymous function inside a ticker is
# garbage the collector has to walk later, and the collector runs in the middle
# of a frame. The list collector on the enemy bars was building a table for the
# list, one per mob in it and two closures every fifth of a second, about eighty
# objects a second to answer a question whose answer almost never changed. An
# allocation behind an if is a cache being filled once and is fine; an
# allocation the tick reaches every time is not.
#
# A string is the fourth shape and it was missed for a long time. `:format(`,
# `string.format(` and the `..` operator each hand back a fresh string, and Lua
# interns none of them, so a label built every tick is garbage on the same
# terms a table is. It is worse than a table in one way: the string usually
# goes straight into a SetText, and a SetText of a string that compares equal
# to the one already there still costs the measure. That was item 34.
# ThreatState built its percentage into a string and its caller compared the
# string against what the bar was drawing, so the guard read as a guard and let
# every tick through. The rule is: compare the numbers, format after.
#
# Reading `..` off a line takes a small lexer rather than a match, because the
# scan skips a whole-line comment and nothing else. A trailing `-- two dots ..`
# on a line of code, and a `..` inside a string literal, are both text and
# neither is a concatenation. So `code_of` walks the line, drops anything from
# an unquoted `--` or `[[` to the end of it, and blanks what is inside quotes.
# Varargs are the other false hit: `...` is three dots and is not an operator,
# so it comes out before the two-dot test.
#
# To exempt one line, put `-- unguarded: <reason>` or `-- allocates: <reason>`
# on it. A reason is required, because an exemption without one is the same
# invisible debt as a warning. A whole function that a tick reaches but does not
# run every tick says so with `-- cold: <reason>` above its definition, which
# stops scripts/hot.lua's walk there.
#
# The list is derived rather than typed. scripts/hot.lua walks out from every
# ticker and every OnUpdate and prints one `File.lua:Function` per line, and its
# own header says how it resolves a call and what it deliberately cannot follow.
#
# It used to be two hundred lines here, written by hand. A hand-written
# transitive closure has one failure mode and it is silent: a hot function grows
# a new callee, nobody adds it, and the scan below comes off that code with
# nothing to report. The derived closure is 335 functions against those 200, and
# the 135 it found include a per-tick SetShown in UnitFrames/Block.lua that
# nothing had ever scanned.

# The four exemptions this scan honours, each one allow-listed by name.
#
# Two of them are the markers above a definition, `-- hot:` and `-- cold:`, and
# two are the per-line `-- unguarded:` and `-- allocates:`. All four are the same
# thing: a place the walk or the scan was told something it could not work out.
# All four are the shape an allow-list has, and none of them was one.
#
# The markers were a pair of counts, HOT_MARKERS and COLD_MARKERS, held exactly
# equal to what src/ carried. That is a ceiling and scripts/ratchet.lua refuses
# to see it raised, so a ninth `cold:` had no legal path in any number of
# commits: raising the number fails the ratchet, lowering it first fails the
# equality, and deleting a marker to buy room fails the equality too. A gate
# with no legal door is not strict, it is a gate people go round.
#
# And the door they go round it by was standing open. The two line exemptions
# were not counted at all. Fifteen of them, uncapped, honoured by the same awk
# below, growing without anyone deciding. The gate blocked the measured door and
# left the unmeasured one wide, which is exactly the pressure that puts the next
# exemption on a line instead of a function.
#
# So all four are lists now, in the path-keyed shape the harness budgets below
# already use and scripts/ratchet.lua already reads:
#
#   path:how many that file carries:what is exempt and why
#
# A file that did not appear before is a new key, and a new key is legal: this
# refuses a raise, not an addition. Raising a file that is already on the list
# still fails, which is the move that reads as progress and is not. The count is
# exact in both directions, so an exemption retired comes off the list in the
# same commit rather than leaving room the next one spends unremarked.
#
# The marker lists name the function too, and the marker sets are read out of
# scripts/hot.lua rather than grepped for a second time here. One reader of that
# syntax means the list and the code cannot drift into disagreeing about what a
# marker says or which definition it sits above: a marker renamed, moved to
# another function or deleted fails here by name.
#
# `cold:` is the largest of the four and it is a work list, not a settled shape.
# Seven of the fifteen are a builder or a layout pass, which is one repeated
# idea: a function whose writes belong to a widget appearing rather than to the
# tick that found it. If UI/ ever grows a construction seam those seven go
# through, this list is eight entries. Four of the rest are a part talking to
# you rather than drawing: the three in the mouse tracer and ns.Print under it.

# One file talks to Blizzard's tooltip, and it is UI/Scan.lua.

# The addon draws its own tooltip: a flat box, the theme's palette, the addon's
# own sans, one physical pixel of edge. GameTooltip is a tiled parchment with a
# gold border drawn off a corner sheet. Every file that named GameTooltip put
# one of those on the screen beside the other, and there were six of them: the
# action squares, the aura squares, the chat log's links, the minimap clock, the
# meter header and the charge icon. Nothing was wrong at any one site, which is
# exactly why it went on for six files.
#
# The stats, the rank, the cost and the enchant line are computed inside the
# game and no API hands them over, so reading them off a hidden GameTooltip is
# the only supported way to get at them. UI/Scan.lua does that and hands the
# text back as data. Every other file asks for a subject and gets the addon's
# own box.
#
# Comments are read too, on purpose. A file explaining what it does to
# GameTooltip is a file that thinks it still owns one.

# and the caller has to check for the call it means to make. That is six lines
# and a paragraph explaining them, and five files wrote both out: Quests/Where,
# Quests/Tracker, Quests/Party, Map/Pins and Comfort/Clutter. Four of the five
# were character for character the same, and Where.lua handed its copy back out
# as Where.Module so Quests/Drops could borrow it, which is the shape a probe
# takes on the way to being everywhere.
#
# ns.Questie in Core/Core.lua is that probe, asked for by the name of the module
# and the names of the calls the reader is about to make. It is the rule item 21
# wrote with a name on it: outside Core, a file does not probe for a call it

# `_G` is read 365 times outside Core/ and most of those are a frame fetched by
# name, `_G["MultiBarBottomLeftButtonName"..i]`, which is the client's own
# naming scheme and is not a probe at all. A gate on `_G` would have been 365
# violations, which is a warning wearing a gate's clothes.
#
# So the rule names the shape it refuses rather than the symbol: `type(_G.Foo)`
# or `type(_G[name])`, which is the question "does this client have this call"
# and nothing else. That shape is 78 sites in 39 files, small enough to hold
# exactly, and every one of them is a file deciding for itself which flavour it
# is running on. Core/ is exempt because deciding that is what Core is for:
# ns.Questie, ns.RegisterUnitEvent and the thirty shims beside them exist so a
# feature file can call one name and not know the answer.

# because a grep is instant and because the message can name the call to use
# instead, which a measurement after the fact cannot.

# Each entry is a pattern, then what to write instead, separated by a pipe. That
# means no pattern may contain one: `read` splits on the first, so an
# alternation would land half in the pattern and half in the message, and the
# only symptom is grep complaining about an unmatched bracket while the rule
# quietly stops checking anything. Write two entries instead.
#
# A label finished by concatenation is not here and cannot be: `"collect " ..
# entry.collects` reads correctly only once the feed's name is glued on, and no
# grep can tell that from a label somebody left a space on the end of. The
# harness checks the string the feature actually produced, which is the only

# four parts are absent rather than merely quiet: a hidden charge button is
# still a secure frame holding a key override, and the action targeting CVar has
# to come out with the value it went in with. A priest fills in one, and it is
# the field that opens no page: the rail entry named after you is dropped, which
# is a branch neither of the other two files reaches, because both carry a bar
# plan and a plan opens a page. A hunter has no file, which is a supported class
# and the one that proves the ten class-agnostic parts still stand up with
# nothing registered.
#
# Per spec rather than per class because a spec decides more than a class does.

# spec that overruns a cap or writes a plan out of shape fails at PLAYER_LOGIN
# as a Lua error in somebody's game. Two of the twelve are only reachable this

# file or a spec this loop did not name got no run at all and what that hid was
