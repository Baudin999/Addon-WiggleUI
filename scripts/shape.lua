-- What shape the code is in, measured per function rather than per file.
--
-- This replaces a per-file line ceiling. A line count says how much there is
-- and nothing about whether it can be read, and the only move it rewards is
-- cutting a file in half, which changes no function and no dependency. Two
-- things happened under the old gate and both are the reason this one exists:
-- one agent hit the ceiling and raised the number, and another took a split it
-- had not gone looking for. Neither wrote a better function.
--
-- So the three numbers here are the ones that survive a file being cut in half,
-- because each is a property of a function and not of a file.
--
--   length      a function you cannot see the ends of at once. The reader
--               holds the top in their head while reading the bottom, and
--               that is the cost, whatever file it lives in.
--   depth       how many conditions are true at the deepest point. Depth is
--               how many of them the reader is carrying.
--   branches    the decisions in one function. Every one is a path, and the
--               paths multiply while the tests do not.
--
-- Both clients ship Lua 5.1, so the scan is a lexer rather than a parser: it
-- walks the text once, skipping strings and comments, and counts the block
-- keywords. That is enough to be exact about all three, because Lua closes
-- every block with `end` or `until` and there is no `}` to guess at.
--
--   lua5.1 ../scripts/shape.lua <file> [file...]
--
-- Prints one line per violation and exits 1 if there were any.

-- The three numbers, set at what the code measures today. Every function in
-- the addon is under them, so nothing new may be worse than the worst thing
-- that already exists, and the entries below are what stands between these and
-- numbers worth having.
local FUNCTION_LINES = 100
local NESTING = 4
local BRANCHES = 30

-- Every function allowed past one of the three, with the number it measures
-- today and why. Three rules hold this list honest.
--
-- An entry needs a reason. An exemption nobody explained is the invisible debt
-- the file ceiling used to hide, so a missing `why` fails like a violation.
--
-- An entry names one function, not a file. Cutting the file in half moves
-- nothing here, which is the whole point of measuring functions.
--
-- An entry ratchets, in both directions and by two files. A function that
-- measures under its own number fails here, so an improvement cannot be spent
-- quietly on room to grow again. A number that goes up fails in
-- scripts/ratchet.lua, which reads the committed copy of this file and refuses
-- the edit that raises a ceiling to meet the function that just cleared it.
-- This file cannot catch that one: an entry raised to exactly what the code now
-- measures is an entry this scan agrees with.
--
-- The reasons fall into three kinds and it is worth seeing them as kinds: a
-- builder that places every region of one widget in one pass, a combat log
-- dispatch with one branch per event, and a walk over something the client
-- indexes in two dimensions. Only the first is a shape anybody would defend,
-- which is what makes this list a work list.
--
-- There was a fourth, the slash dispatcher with one branch per word, and it is
-- gone. Two entries carried it, and both retired when the words became a table
-- walked by ns.Command.Word rather than a chain of ifs. That is what this list
-- is for: an entry comes off it because the shape it excused stopped existing.
