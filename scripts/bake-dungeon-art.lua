-- Bakes src/Dungeons/Art.lua out of Blizzard's own instance tables.
--
--   lua5.1 scripts/bake-dungeon-art.lua <path to a folder of wago.tools exports>
--
-- Run through scripts/bake-dungeon-art.sh, which fetches the exports and checks
-- the result.
--
-- **What this is for.** The shelf is a page of cards, one per dungeon, and a
-- card wants a picture of the place. Retail draws that picture out of the
-- Encounter Journal's own art, which the 2.5 client does not ship: its
-- interface manifest has no interface/encounterjournal folder in it at all, so
-- there is nothing there to point at and no amount of asking the client will
-- make one.
--
-- What it does ship is the loading screen. Every instance in the game carries
-- one, it is a painting of that place made by the same artists, and it is the
-- picture a player has already looked at on the way in. So the card wears the
-- loading screen, and the join from a dungeon to its screen is what this bakes.
--
-- **The client will not answer this either.** LoadingScreens is a table the
-- client reads on the way into an instance and exposes to nothing; there is no
-- call on either of these clients that turns a dungeon into its art. A texture
-- is drawn by path all the same, which is the same fact Dungeons/Sheets.lua is
-- built on.
--
-- Three exports, and every one of them is Blizzard's own table:
--
--   map.csv       the 2.5 client's instance list, which is what says that
--                 "Coilfang: The Steamvault" is a five man and which loading
--                 screen it carries.
--   screens.csv   LoadingScreens, which turns that id into a file id.
--   files.csv     ManifestInterfaceData, which turns a file id into the path
--                 the texture is drawn by. Nothing is baked that this cannot
--                 name, because a path that does not resolve draws nothing at
--                 all and says nothing about it.
--
-- **The editorial half is eight lines and it is the names.** The book calls a
-- place what a player calls it, which for eight of the forty is not what the
-- client files it under. Everything else binds on the client's own name, or on
-- the part of it after the colon: Blizzard files the four Auchindoun wings and
-- the three Coilfang ones as "Auchindoun: Sethekk Halls" and "Coilfang: The
-- Underbog", and the book, like everybody at a summoning stone, calls them
-- Sethekk Halls and the Underbog.
