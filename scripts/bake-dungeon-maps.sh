#
# Neither of the two clients this addon ships for will say what a dungeon's map
# looks like. The 1.15 one has no dungeon maps in its map tree; the 2.5 one has
# a hundred and four and files art for none of them. Both ship the tiles under
# Interface\WorldMap all the same, so the picture is drawn by path and the path
# is what this bakes.
#
# Six exports, and every one of them is Blizzard's own table:
#
#   uimap.csv         the 2.5 client's map list. Which dungeon maps that client
#                     has, what it calls them and what id each is.
#   groupmembers.csv  which floor of which place a map is, and what the floor is
#                     called. The 2.5 client does not ship this table, so it is
#                     read out of a build that still does.
#   xmapart.csv       which art belongs to which map.
#   arts.csv          which style that art is cut in.
#   styles.csv        what that style's size and tile size are.
#   tiles.csv         the tiles themselves, as file ids.
#   files.json        which path each file id is filed under, so nothing is
#                     baked that cannot be checked.
#
# They come from wago.tools, which serves Blizzard's tables per build. This is
# not a dependency of the addon and is not needed to run it. It is needed to run
# this, once, when the dungeon list changes.
