# Bakes src/Media/Glyphs.ttf out of the Font Awesome Free solid face.
#
# A glyph here is a mark this addon draws at the size of a letter: a chevron, a
# cross, a plus. An icon is the game's own art for a spell, which UI/Draw.lua
# crops and UI.Icon hands out. Two different things, two words, and this is the
# first.
#
# Eleven glyphs, and each is drawn on a letter the addon can stand to fall back
# to. Five were the panel's and were already the letter it drew: the chevrons on
# `v` and `>`, the close cross on `x`, and the stepper's own `+` and `-`. Three
# are the loot feed's filter chips, so the letter was a choice: `*` for the gem
# that grades an item, `!` for the quest mark, and `$` for coin. The ninth is
# the chat window's voice button on `m`, which is the first letter of the word
# the button is about and is what a client with no font face draws instead.
#
# The last two are the quest log's. `V` is the tick against a quest you can hand
# in, and it is a capital because lowercase `v` is already the chevron and one
# letter cannot be two marks. `s` is the share arrow on a quest row, on the
# first letter of the word for the reason the microphone is.
#
# That choice is the whole trick. Nothing in the Lua carries a codepoint escape
# and nothing has to know it is looking at an icon. A string given the icon font
# draws the icon; the same string given the text font draws the letter, which is
# what a client refusing the font gets. `!` in Arial Narrow beside `!` in Font
# Awesome is the same mark twice, and `$` is money either way, so the chips
# survive that client as marks rather than as three empty squares.
#
# The source is the system copy rather than a download, because a build step
# that reaches the network is a build step that breaks when you are on a train.
#
#   pacman -S woff2-font-awesome python-fonttools    (or the same two elsewhere)
#   ./bake-icons.sh
#
# The output is about 1.8 KB and is committed, because the addon ships to people
# who have neither of those packages.
