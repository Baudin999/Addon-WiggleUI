-- a fourth spec is covered the moment check.sh reads the file.
--
-- Both readings the resolver uses are driven, because a spec is named by

-- spells of every other spec are made unknown, so no spec but the wanted one
-- can be signed for; the wanted spec's tree is given every point, so the
-- fallback lands on it for the specs that carry no signature at all. A warrior
-- with Death Wish is fury whatever his trees say, and priest holy has nothing
-- to be signed for and is answered by its tree alone.
--
-- The run is refused rather than allowed to drift. A spec the addon then reads

	-- fold, the shared cursor and one quest's own text, and this is a zone with
	-- Questie's answer drawn on it under a wheel and a drag.
	"47-quest-map",
	-- Under that, because it reads what those two sections leave: the window
	-- on screen, the log three quests short of what it started with, and the
	-- footer button driven once per quest. It puts five rows into the log and
	-- takes them out again, and it ends with nothing pinned.
	"47-quest-pin",
	-- Under it, and it leaves Questie ready for good. Everything above this
	-- line runs against a Questie whose database has not finished compiling,
	-- which is the state a login is in and the one worth testing the addon in;
	-- nothing below reads the flag.
	"47-questie-api",
	-- Last, and it registers a source of its own that stays registered. A
	-- section after this one would be reading tooltips with the harness's own
	-- line hooked into them.
	-- Which key presses the thing under the cursor, on an item's box and on a
	-- square's. Before 48-tooltips, which is the last section that may read a
	-- tooltip without the harness's own line in it.
	"48-key-line",
	"48-tooltips",
	-- Straight after it and for the same reason it is late: this registers a
	-- source of its own that stays registered too. Its line answers only a note
	-- carrying a `stamped` field and nothing below writes one, and its stamp
	-- answers the same number for every other note, so what the sections under
	-- here inherit is a tick that arms on a note hover and rebuilds nothing.
	"48-tooltip-fresh",
	-- Beside it, and for the same reason both are apart from 48-tooltips: this
	-- is a box that has to change after it was drawn rather than a claim about
	-- what a box says. It hovers an item the client has never heard of, which
	-- is a link with no entry in the stub's item table, and leaves that table
	-- as it found it.
	"48-tooltip-arrival",
	"49-world-hover",
	-- After 48-tooltips, which is fine and is worth saying why: what that
	-- section leaves registered is a source that answers only a subject
	-- carrying its own probe field, and nothing here carries one.
	"50-experience-rails",
	-- It moves the addon's lock and puts it back, so it wants everything above
	-- it built and nothing above it disturbed. Second to last for that reason.
	"51-placing",
	-- It takes Blizzard's character sheet out of the attic and puts it back, and
	-- it moves the weapon skill the whole miss calculation is built on. Both are
	-- scene changes, so it goes under everything that reads either: the hide
	-- section three dozen lines above, and the placing walk directly over it,
	-- which counts this window among the six it holds to the lock.
	-- Before it, and that is the whole of why it is a file of its own rather
	-- than a block in it. The first thing it asserts is that the standings
	-- window does not exist, and 52-character reaches that window through the
	-- client's own reputation page name a hundred lines in.
	"52-standings",
	"52-character",
	-- Straight after it, and it was a block in the middle of it. The numbers on
	-- the stats column are arithmetic against three published figures rather than
	-- a reading of the window, and nothing that file does after the block ran
	-- moves one of them: it puts the weapon skill, the off hand and the ratings
	-- back where it found them, and so does this. A file of its own because it is
	-- a second subject and because 52-character.lua was over its own line ceiling
	-- carrying both.
	"52-stats-page",
	-- Straight after it, and it opens the sheet itself. What the gear page draws
	-- is a bigger subject than the rest of that window and it grew past the line
	-- ceiling the section was already exempted from, so it is a file: the split
	-- gave 52-character's exemption back rather than raising it.
	"52-gear-page",
	-- After both of them, and it is the window rather than the page: the wash
	-- UI/Window.lua lays over a screen window's own half of the monitor. It was
	-- a block at the foot of the gear page and took that file over the line
	-- ceiling, which is what noticed that it was in the wrong one.
	--
	-- Under 52-character rather than over it, because that section's first
	-- assertion is that nothing has opened the sheet yet and this one opens it.
	-- It shuts it again, and it puts the setting it turns off back, so what the
	-- reset below inherits is the scene the addon ships with.
	"52-screen-dark",
	-- Straight after the wash, because it is the same question about the same
	-- window from the other side: the wash owns the world behind the sheet and
	-- this owns the addon's own rectangles in front of it. It opens the sheet the
	-- way that section does and shuts it again, and it puts its own setting back,
	-- so the reset below still inherits the scene the addon ships with.
	"52-screen-hush",
	-- Under those, and it opens the same sheet again. What it reads is the one
	-- thing on a gear square that moves while nobody touches it: the arc a slot
	-- you press draws while its cooldown runs. It puts a trinket on cooldown,
	-- runs the wait down, takes the trinket off and puts it back, so the scene
	-- it hands on is the one it was given. A file of its own because
	-- 52-gear-page.lua is at its own line ceiling and this is a subject rather
	-- than a block: two halves, two masks and a tick that has to stop.
	--
	-- Over the enchant section rather than under it, because this one reads the
	-- character client/13-character.lua dressed and that one is the section that
	-- redresses him.
	"52-trinket-sweep",
	-- Last of the sheet's sections, because it dresses the character in
	-- enchanted pieces and puts a stone on a hand. Every assertion above reads
	-- a character wearing what client/13-character.lua put on, so a scene that
	-- changes what is in four slots goes below all of them and puts it back.
	"52-gear-enchant",
	-- Last, and it has to be: it puts every setting in the account file back
	-- to what the addon ships with, twice over, which is the one thing in the
	-- suite that would pull the scene out from under every section above it.
	"53-shipped-defaults",
	-- Under the reset, which is not the exception to the line above it that it
	-- looks like. What that section pulls out from under everything is the
	-- settings, and the two this one needs are the two the addon ships with, so
	-- a scene freshly reset to them is exactly the scene it wants. It reads
	-- nothing any earlier section left behind and it is the last word on where
	-- you are standing, which it moves into a zone the map tree holds.
	"54-world-map",
	-- Last, and it is the only section in the suite that puts a free slot in
	-- the bags. Every other one is written against a character carrying a full
	-- set, because a hole in a bag moves the numbers the vendor sweep and the
	-- clutter queue count, so the empty bag goes in here and comes out again at
	-- the foot of the file.
	"55-bags",
	-- Last. It walks the map tree again for dungeons, puts you inside one, and
	-- opens a loot window over a boss corpse, which is the one loot window in
	-- the suite that says which corpse a slot came out of. It takes that away
	-- again and puts you back where 54-world-map.lua left you standing.
	"56-dungeon-log",
	-- Last. It is the only section that stands you in front of a vendor with
	-- the full rack up, and it parks the client's own merchant window and takes
	-- it back again. It ends with the purse it found and no merchant open.
	"57-merchant",
	"58-spec",
	"59-chat-history",
	-- Straight after it, because it reads the rail that section wiped clean
	-- and closes conversations of its own making. What it asks is the four
	-- things the window grew after the history did: a picture size, a way to
	-- close a conversation, a box to copy a room out of, and a room for what
	-- the addon says.
	"59-chat-rooms",

	-- Last, and not about a feature. It drives one word of each kind the
	-- slash runner parses and reads the setting back, which is a question
	-- about ns.Command.Word rather than about any of the parts above.
	"60-slash-words",

	-- Last, and after 55-bags.lua for the reason every section in that pair
	-- runs in order: it changes what is in the trash bag under a running
	-- session and puts it back. It also stands up GetZoneText, which no client
	-- stub provides, and takes it down again.
	"61-bag-session",

	-- Last, and after 55-bags.lua and 61-bag-session.lua both, because it puts
	-- that scene back to draw the bag window one more time. It is the only
	-- section that seeds the client's binding line, and it leaves the seed
	-- behind: nothing after it reads a tooltip off a bag slot.
	"62-bag-lanes",

	-- Last, and after 54-world-map.lua, whose window it opens again and whose
	-- fixtures it reads. It is the only section that makes Questie draw
	-- something rather than reading what Questie drew, and it puts every
	-- place it switched back the way it found it.
	"63-map-places",
	"64-console",
	"65-bag-piles",
	"66-bag-drop",
	"67-talents",
	"68-spellbook",

	-- Last, and it is the only section that stands a corpse up other than the
	-- four slots 22-chores.lua counts. It swaps one in with a slot per rule the
	-- loot filter has, drives every rule over it, and puts those four back at
	-- the foot of the file. It also installs a stand-in for Comfort/Reagents.lua
	-- for two passes and takes it away again, because what the filter has to do
	-- when that part is missing is half of what it promises.
	"69-loot-filter",
	-- Last, and it is the only section that opens a profession window. It
	-- reads what no section above it has touched, a list that is empty until
	-- this one fills it, and it ends by emptying it again and shutting both
	-- windows, so nothing after it would find a scene it did not expect.
	"70-reagents",
	-- The only section that takes every bag off the character and hands back
	-- its own. What it measures is where one looted item landed and how much
	-- of the stack it landed in came out again, and a bag of the fixtures' own
	-- holding a second stack of the same cloth would answer that question for
	-- it. The character's bags go back at the foot of the file.
	"71-leftovers",
	-- The charge button's pick, by stance and by what is trained. It moves
	-- combat, the stance, the cursor and the book, and puts all four back.
	"72-charge-stance",
	-- What a square answers past its own cooldown: the ladder the cooldown
	-- row and the racial read through Buttons/Castable.lua, and which of the
	-- three Berserkings a troll gets. Moves the clock, the target, the race
	-- and what is affordable, and puts all four back.
	"73-castable",
	"74-bag-hold",
	-- Last, and after 55-bags.lua and 46-mail.lua both: it opens the mail
	-- window over a built bag window and right clicks the squares. The bag
	-- window is built once and 55-bags.lua asserts on that first build, which
	-- is why this cannot sit in the mail section where it was.
	"75-mail-bags",
	-- The bars you made yourself. It adds bars, takes keys and puts a spell
	-- on the cursor, and it deletes every bar and clears the cursor at the
	-- foot of the file, so nothing after it finds a key held or a scene it
	-- did not expect.
	"76-adhoc",
	-- Last, because it stubs four client calls and a CVar to arrange each of
	-- the four answers a dip can have, and puts all five back at the foot of
	-- the file. It also counts 250 events into the census and fires 300
	-- combat log lines, which is the loudest thing any section does and
	-- belongs nowhere near a section reading a frame.
	"77-frame-trace",
	-- After the frame trace rather than before it, which is the one place a
	-- section that reads frames can sit next to that one: it puts every call it
	-- stubbed back at the foot of its own file, and the row below is built at
	-- login and reads nothing it touched. It fills every totem slot and empties
	-- them again, so nothing after it would find a scene it did not expect.
	"78-standing-row",
	-- Last, and it has to be. It drains everything the loot sections left
	-- floating and then runs the animation tick out to nothing, which is a
	-- state no section above it expects to find and none below it would
	-- survive.
	"79-floating-messages",
	-- After it, which is the one place a section that drives an animation can
	-- sit beside that one. 79 runs the tween tick out to nothing and asserts it
	-- gave its OnUpdate back; this drives a different library on a different
	-- ticker, and it clears everything in the air at the head of the file
	-- because three sections above it fire combat log lines that this part has
	-- been reading since login.
	"80-floating-numbers",
	-- Under both of them, and it has to be. It drives a tween library on the
	-- gear page, and the sheet's other five sections all run above
	-- 79-floating-messages, which asserts that a dozen looted drops are still
	-- in the air and unticked: a beat of the animation tick from up there would
	-- expire them and read as that section's failure. Here the list is empty
	-- when it starts and empty when it hands over.
	"81-gear-arrival",
	-- Last, because it reads the state four sections above it left. It wants a
	-- quest in the log, a profession window that has been walked and a corpse in
	-- front of you at the same time, and 47, 69 and 70 are what put those three
	-- there. It hands every one of them back at the foot of the file the way they
	-- were handed over, so it can go on being last when the next one arrives.
	"82-need",
	-- Last, because it walks you round the map tree: it stands you in four
	-- zones and three dungeons, takes IsInInstance off the client and puts
	-- Questie away twice, and ends by asking what a client that will not say
	-- which map you are on answers. It puts every one of those back at the foot
	-- of the file, including where you were standing when it started.
	"83-quest-here",
	-- Last, because it takes Questie away three ways and reaches into that
	-- addon's own saved settings to do it. Everything above this line reads
	-- Questie; this is the one section that writes to it. It puts the global,
	-- the setting and both switches back at the foot of the file.
	"84-questie-tracker",
	-- Last, and under 84-questie-tracker because it throws the same switch: the
	-- box that takes Questie's tracker off the screen is the box that puts this
	-- addon's own tracker up, and this is the half of that pair which draws.
	-- It walks you through three zones, empties the client's log and puts it
	-- back, pins a quest and unpins it, and moves the addon's lock. Every one of
	-- those, and where you were standing, is handed back at the foot of the file.
	"85-quest-column",
	-- Last, and it wants the gear 13-character.lua put on you: the one piece in
	-- this client with holes in it is the helmet, and the session this section
	-- opens is opened on the slot that helmet is worn in. It stands a fourth bag
	-- of gems up and takes it down again at the foot of the file, the way
	-- 65-bag-piles.lua hands its fifth bag back.
	"86-sockets",
	-- Last, and it wants the action slots every section above it has been
	-- writing into: it empties all 120 of them, lays out a bar of its own and
	-- hands back what it found at the foot of the file. Nothing above it reads
	-- the spell book and the action slots together, which is the pair this one
	-- is about.
	"87-spell-ranks",
	-- Last, and it is the only section that changes what the client says is
	-- installed. Everything else here runs on a client with no other addon
	-- loaded, which is the state the notice has to stay quiet in, so this one
	-- loads three, reads what it says and unloads them again at the foot of the
	-- file. It also fires PLAYER_LOGIN a second time, which is what the notice
	-- being said once is measured on and is the reason it is under everything
	-- rather than beside the other Core sections.
	"88-other-addons",
}

-- Naming a section runs every section up to and including it, rather than that
-- one on its own. A section reads what the ones above it left behind, so one
-- run in isolation is not a smaller version of the suite, it is a crash. The
-- prefix is the smallest run that can honestly answer for the section named.
