-- more than the rest of that window put together and is why it is a file.
--
-- It was the middle hundred lines of 52-character.lua and that file sat on its
-- own line ceiling, so every assertion the names, the sockets and the figure
-- behind them needed had nowhere to go. Raising the ceiling is the move
-- scripts/ratchet.lua exists to refuse. Splitting the subject out drops
-- 52-character under the limit everything else is held to and gives its
-- exemption back, which is the same trade the other four entries on that list
-- are still waiting to make.

-- The window is opened and shut here rather than inherited. This section runs
-- after 52-character has finished with the sheet and hidden it, so nothing
-- above is left standing to read.
--
-- What this cannot prove: that any of it looks like anything. A mask, a vertex
-- colour and a frame level are three calls the client answers nothing about,
-- and all three are load bearing for the page reading as one picture. What is
-- asserted is that each of them was made and landed on the right object.

-- The tabs

-- everything else the client calls a skill; standings is your reputation.

-- "Professions", so the fixture's blacksmithing has to land beside the

-- calls answer half each: the link says what is in it, GetItemStats says how

-- draw filled first and open after, which is the only order the client supports.
--
-- A disc carries the gem now rather than standing in for it, so what the

-- because a disc that draws the right picture in the wrong number of places is
-- the same bug it always was.
--
-- What cannot be asserted is the socket's own colour, and that is the data

-- The figure is yours to turn
--

-- turn, a walk nearer and a pair of weapons are four numbers handed to the
-- client, so the client stub in client/13-character.lua keeps them and this
-- reads them back. Without that they are four calls into a no-op and a figure
-- that never moved would pass every assertion here.
--
-- What each block is for, and each one is a bug that has a name:
--
--   A right press arms nothing. The right button is the camera's and the sheet
--   is half the screen, so a figure that took the right drag would spin every
--   time the player tried to look around.
--
--   The wheel stops at both ends. There is no reset on this page and the sheet
--   fills half a monitor: a figure wound out of that half is only undone by
--   winding the wheel back, and a clamp that is off by a notch is invisible
--   until somebody scrolls.
--
--   The pose survives a redress. SetUnit builds the figure again from nothing,
--   so an angle applied once at login would be gone the first time you put a
--   ring on, and the page would still measure perfectly.
--
--   And every one of the three is written to this character's own saved
--   variables at the moment it moves, which is what "the sheet opens the way
--   you left it" is made of.
--
-- Every press here is aimed at a point and delivered by H.mouse, so the stub
-- decides who gets it. That matters more here than in most sections: the whole
-- claim is that a press on the figure reaches the figure, and a handler called
-- by name proves it about a frame that might be under the page.
