-- The mail part
--
-- Six questions no amount of reading Mail/ will answer.
--
-- Does a name resolve to the right one of three. That is the whole feature in
-- one call, and the two ways it can be wrong look identical in the source: a
-- test that answers yes to everything paints the window green and warns about
-- nothing, and one that answers no to everything paints it red and warns about
-- your own bank alt until you stop reading the band.
--
-- Does more than twelve attachments become more than one mail, with the right
-- twelve in the first one. The client's form has twelve slots and fills from the
-- bags, so an addon that got this wrong would send twelve and quietly drop the
-- rest, which looks exactly like a successful send from the outside.
--
-- Does the subject write itself, per mail rather than per send. Mail two of
-- three is named after what is in mail two, and a split subject that fitted its
-- own suffix rather than being cut by the server at sixty four.
--
-- Does the send wait for the server. The state machine exists because a loop
-- would fill one form three times in one frame; a stub that answered
-- synchronously would never produce the shape it is written against, so the
-- success here is delivered by hand.
--
-- Does the second mail of a split survive bags that are still moving. This is
-- the one that was broken in game, and it is the same shape the inbox sweep was
-- broken in. Mail two is filled from inside mail one's success, which is the
-- one moment in a send when every slot the next batch wants may be locked, and
-- a fill that counted a locked slot as an item that had gone stopped the run
-- with "nothing of that mail is still in your bags". Twelve went, eight stayed
-- in the bags, and the window said it had sent everything it could.
--
-- Does a refusal stop the rest. A mail the server would not take has left its
-- attachments on the form, and posting the next one on top of them would send
-- somebody else's items to this recipient.
--
-- And can that be undone without walking away. A refused mail leaves twelve
-- items on a form parked off the side of the screen. Nothing on screen says so,
-- every send after it is refused for that reason, and until the clear button
-- reached the form there was no press in the window that changed it.
--
-- And does the sweep count down. Taking a message renumbers the inbox, and a
-- sweep walking upwards skips every other message while reporting that it took
-- them all.
--
-- Does the sweep survive a server that answers before it has finished. This is
-- the one that was broken in game. The first MAIL_INBOX_UPDATE after a take
-- arrives with the coin gone and the attachment still on the message, so a
-- sweep that decides on one unchanged reading gives up on every ordinary
-- auction mail and reports most of a full mailbox as messages that would not
-- empty. The stub answers late on request, and the assertion is that the whole
-- mailbox still comes out.
--
-- And does a full bag stop one message rather than the sweep. Coin needs no
-- room, and a mailbox of gold behind one leftover stack is what the old halt
-- left sitting there.
