-- cooldown was running, and drew ready on every other answer. Bloodthirst read
-- ready at five rage, Overpower read ready with nothing having dodged you, and
-- a troll shaman's Berserking read ready for the whole of its three minutes
-- because the id the row held was the rogue's. The action bars had every one
-- of those rungs and the row had none.
--
-- Buttons/Castable.lua is the one ladder both climb now, and this section
-- drives it from the row's side. The row's own reads come first, moved here
-- from 42-cooldown-row.lua because every answer is held for the frame it was
-- given in and this section moves the clock between reads. Then each rung the
-- row never had, then the racial, which reads the same ladder and finds its id
-- in the book rather than in a table keyed by race.
