-- A whole word or none of it
--
-- The middle column of a feed row was the one place in the addon where a string
-- and the room it had been given were never compared. A stream asks for a width
-- in units, UI/Feed.lua hands back half of what is left after the number at
-- most, and a font string given less than its string needs draws what fits and
-- drops the rest. Nothing errors and nothing is logged. The row reads as a mob
-- whose name stops mid-word.
--
-- Feeds/Combat.lua is the one that clips. It asks for 96 units and its widest
-- string, "from Plains Creeper", measures 131 in the shipped face at a row's
-- text size, so there is no width of that feed at which the column holds it:
-- the panel's ceiling of 520 units grants the whole 96 and 96 is not enough.
-- Feeds/Loot.lua has no middle column: its quest count stands in the number
-- column, whose 52 units hold the widest count an objective can carry.
--
-- Three claims, and not one of them can be read off the source.
--
-- **A note wider than its column is not drawn at all.** The string still
-- arrives and the row still holds it. What goes is a player being shown two
-- thirds of a name.
--
-- **One that fits is still drawn.** The rule is a comparison, and a comparison
-- written the wrong way round empties every middle column in the addon. That is
-- a feature going quiet in exactly the way this one is meant to, and from the
-- outside the two are the same screen.
--
-- **The answer moves with what the player did.** The column is the stream's ask
-- or half the free width, whichever is smaller, so the same note draws at one
-- feed width and goes at the next one down. And it is a measurement that
-- decides rather than a count of characters: one string at two text sizes comes
-- out on two sides of one column.
--
-- A file of its own because 31-feeds.lua is at the line ceiling every section
-- shares, and because this is the widget's rule rather than either feed's: both
-- streams are read here and the code under it is in UI/Feed.lua.
--
-- What this cannot prove: that the client's text engine measures what the
-- harness models. client/02-text.lua runs 0.53 em a glyph where Media/Sans.ttf
-- runs 0.481 over the addon's own strings, which is slack in the safe
-- direction, and every number in the prose above is the face's rather than the
-- model's.
