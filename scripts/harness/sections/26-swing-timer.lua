-- The swing timer
--
-- Five questions, and only the last of them is about drawing.
--
-- Does the log start the right hand. The off hand flag is the twenty-first
-- value of SWING_DAMAGE and the second of SWING_MISSED, and reading the wrong
-- slot gives an off hand bar that never runs and a main hand bar that runs at
-- twice the speed. That looks like a haste bug and is a parser bug, which is
-- why it is asserted from both subevents and from a stranger's swing as well
-- as from the player's.
--
-- Does the swing come off the weapon. UnitAttackSpeed is the only source and
-- a swap has to move it, so the speed is changed under a running timer and the
-- bar is measured again.
--
-- Does haste scale what is left rather than restart it. Flurry landing halfway
-- through a swing leaves you halfway through a shorter swing, and a timer that
-- kept the elapsed instead would jump backwards every time it landed. This is
-- the single thing a warrior's swing timer has to get right and it is one line
-- of arithmetic, which is exactly the kind of line that gets rewritten wrong.
--
-- Does the Slam band land where the arithmetic says. The band is the whole
-- feature: a cast of C seconds against a swing of D belongs at (D - C) over D
-- of the bar, in whole pixels, and a band drawn a pixel off is a press that
-- clips. It is asserted as pixels rather than as a fraction, because pixels
-- are what the eye is aiming at.
--
-- And does the tick stay free. This is the only thing in the addon that draws
-- on every frame, so what it allocates per tick is gated below and the fill's
-- unguarded write is measured rather than argued about.
