-- What a word table does with a word
--
-- ns.Command.Word is one runner behind about a hundred slash words, and every
-- one of them used to be four lines written out by hand: parse the value, write
-- ns.db.<key>, call the module's Apply, print a sentence. One runner is worth
-- having and is also one place for all hundred of them to go wrong at once, so
-- the four steps are asserted here rather than trusted.
--
-- The half that matters is the refusal. A dispatcher that prints the range and
-- writes the number anyway looks right from the outside: the message is there,
-- the setting moved, and nobody reads the number back. Every kind the runner
-- knows is driven twice here, once with a value it takes and once with one it
-- does not, and the second is checked on the setting rather than on the words.
--
-- Nothing here is a feature. The words are picked because each is the plainest
-- example of one kind the runner parses, and what is asserted is the runner's
-- behaviour, not the swing timer's.
