-- Which opener, by stance and by what is trained
--
-- One button, three openers, and which one a press casts used to be decided by
-- combat and the cursor alone. Out of combat that was always Charge with a
-- swap to Battle Stance under it, so a fury warrior standing in Berserker
-- Stance paid a press and the rage on every pull for an ability the stance
-- they stood in already had. And nothing asked whether an opener was trained:
-- a level twenty warrior in a fight saw Intervene, fifty levels away, drawn as
-- unknown, and the macro carried a line for it.
--
-- So the stance decides and the spellbook gates, and this section drives every
-- edge of that: each stance out of combat, each stance in a fight with a mob, a
-- party member and nothing under the cursor, and each opener taken out of the
-- book. The macro is read back too, because the icon and the press have to
-- agree and the macro is where the press is.
--
-- The scene is put back the way it was found: combat, stance, the cursor and
-- the book are all shared with what runs after.
