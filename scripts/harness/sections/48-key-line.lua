-- Which key presses it
--
-- The hearthstone's tooltip said everything the client knows about a
-- hearthstone and nothing about which key you press for it, because the key is
-- a fact about the action slot it is standing on and the item's box never
-- asked. Buttons/Bound.lua joins the two: an item subject is walked through
-- the slots for the one holding its id, an action subject is a slot already,
-- and both get the same line.
--
-- Two readings and both are asserted, because they come from different places.
-- With the clone up, GetBindingKey no longer answers for a key the clone holds
-- an override on, so the line has to come off what Bars.ApplyBindings recorded.
-- With the clone down it has to come off the binding set. A test that only ran
-- one of them is a tooltip that goes blank when the bars are switched.
