-- The talent window
--
-- Three trees side by side replacing a window of the client's, and most of
-- this section is about the one promise the window makes: nothing to scroll.
--
-- **The size is asserted against what was drawn, not against a constant.** The
-- window is sized to the tallest tree this character has, so the check is that
-- the lowest square of the deepest tree sits inside the content area and that
-- the whole window still fits the screen at its zoom. A window that grew to
-- fit and then overflowed the monitor would pass the first and fail the
-- second.
--
-- **The lines are measured, not counted.** Four routes are drawn in the
-- fixture, one of each kind: down a column across an empty tier, along a row,
-- a diagonal with a clear short route and a diagonal whose short route is
-- blocked. Each is asserted by where its segments start and how long they
-- are, in the grid's own units, because a count of four proves nothing about
-- which way any of them went.
--
-- **Everything else is what a square cannot say about itself.** Which rim it
-- wears and why, whether a press reached the client, whether the other spec
-- refuses a press, and whether the client's own window is in the attic with
-- its key redirected.
--
-- What this cannot prove: that the client agrees about any of the ten calls
-- behind it. The stub answers what client/18-talents.lua says it answers, and
-- the two clients this addon runs on disagree about three of them, which is
-- why the older shape is stood up here for a moment rather than assumed.
