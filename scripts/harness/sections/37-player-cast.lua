-- Your own cast bar
--
-- The enemy cast row is measured two sections up and almost every answer this
-- bar draws comes out of the same file, so what is asserted here is the half
-- that is not shared.
--
-- That it is a bar of its own. It has a point you drag, a size in whole screen
-- pixels and a grid under it, which the row under an enemy bar does not,
-- because that one is a chamber inside somebody else's box.
--
-- That the fill is the same moving edge. It is held to the three statements the
-- swing bar and the enemy cast row are held to, and for the same reason: on
-- every frame it is given, the drawn position is exactly the elapsed fraction,
-- no frame repeats the one before it, and every step is the same size. This is
-- the one thing in the file that would still look fine in a screenshot after it
-- had stopped being right.
--
-- That a cast which did not finish reads differently from one that did. This is
-- the whole of what a player's cast bar has that a mob's does not: interrupted,
-- moved out of, or refused, the bar goes red and holds where it stopped rather
-- than emptying, because an empty bar is what a finished cast leaves too.
--
-- And that the client's own cast bar went down when ours came up, which is the
-- half nobody notices until there are two of them.
