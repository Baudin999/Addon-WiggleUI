-- The character window
--
-- One page replacing a window of the client's, and most of this section is
-- about the one number on it the client has never drawn.
--
-- **There are no tabs left.** The sheet had four and every one of them went
-- somewhere better: the stats and then the skills into the column down the
-- right of the gear page, which 52-gear-page.lua asserts the fold of, the
-- loadouts out of the addon, the standings into a window of their own that
-- 52-standings.lua covers. What is left here is the window rather than the
-- switch, and the top edge the tabs used to sit in, which is the drag now.
--
-- **The miss maths is next door.** It was here and it is 52-stats-page.lua now,
-- for the reason the split above gives: the numbers on the stats column are
-- arithmetic against three published figures and none of them moves when the
-- window is dragged, opened in a fight or closed. It took the three helpers
-- nothing else read with it.
--
-- **What is left is what a page cannot say about itself.** How many squares
-- were drawn and which of them lit a durability line, whether the client's own
-- sheet is off the screen and its three page names redirected, and whether a
-- click in a fight refused instead of calling.
--
-- What this cannot prove: that the client agrees about any of the thirty calls
-- behind it. The stub answers what client/13-character.lua says it answers.
