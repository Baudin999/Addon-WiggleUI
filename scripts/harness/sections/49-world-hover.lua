-- The hover no frame in the addon owns
--
-- Every other section that touches a tooltip goes through the thing that opened
-- one: a feed row, a nag square, an action square, all of them frames this addon
-- drew and hung an OnEnter on. A creature in the 3D world is none of those. The
-- cursor is over WorldFrame, the client resolves the mouseover token, fills
-- GameTooltip and shows it, and there is no script in that sequence for an addon
-- to write. So this part is built the other way round and every claim in it is a
-- claim the sections above cannot make.
--
--   The unit kind. UI/Scan.lua points its hidden tooltip at a unit token and
--   reads back the name, the level tag and what the thing is. Those five lines
--   are localised and computed inside the game, and the addon has no other way
--   to word any of them.
--
--   The box with no owner. Everything else takes its position and its zoom from
--   the frame it opened on. This one has neither, so it follows the pointer,
--   picks its side the way a frame's tooltip picks one, and reads the cursor in
--   physical pixels through a UI scale that is not 1.
--
--   The suppression, which is the half with the sharp edge. GameTooltip is
--   shared with quest text, with a link somebody clicked in chat and with every
--   other addon installed, so it is held down only while ours is up and only
--   when it is about a unit. Both halves of that are asserted here, because
--   getting the second wrong is a linked item that silently says nothing.
--
--   The hook, from the other end. Meter/Standing.lua registers one line against
--   the unit kind and never learns that this part exists. That is the whole
--   claim ns.Tip.Source is for and it cannot be made from inside the part that
--   opens the box. UnitFrames/Vitals.lua registers two more, health and power,
--   which Blizzard draws as a bar the scanner cannot read or not at all.
