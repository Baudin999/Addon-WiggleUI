-- Mouseover casting
--
-- Six questions, and the first one is the whole feature.
--
-- Does a spell dropped on the slot come back as a spell. This client answers a
-- dragged spell with a spellbook index and the book it came out of, which is
-- one of three shapes Hover/Hover.lua is prepared for, and the reading it lands
-- on decides whether the binding casts Rend or casts nothing. The stub carries
-- that shape and no fourth-slot spell id, so the path asserted here is the path
-- this client is on rather than the one a newer build would take.
--
-- Does the filter reach the macro. Enemy, friend and anything are three macro
-- conditionals and nothing else, so the assertion is on the string the button
-- is actually carrying rather than on a flag beside it.
--
-- Does a key that is also on a bar keep the bar. A heal on a square and the
-- same key on this list is one key that heals the party member under the
-- cursor and heals you with nothing there, and that is two lines of macro on
-- the hover button and a bar that stops binding the key while still drawing
-- it. The stub holds SHIFT-BUTTON3 as bar 1's second key on its first square,
-- so the first binding below is that case without arranging anything.
--
-- Does a key land on the binding layer. Every part of this addon that takes a
-- key reads GetBindingAction back rather than believing its own call, and the
-- suffix is what tells one binding from another, so the readback has to name
-- the index.
--
-- Is the macro written under the name the client looks it up by. This is the
-- one that shipped wrong. The attributes were `type-1` and `macrotext-1`, a
-- secure button reads `<modifiers>type<click>`, and every key bound, read back
-- correctly and cast nothing. The wildcard prefix is the half that matters
-- most: a mouseover key carries a modifier, the modifier is read off the
-- keyboard at the moment of the press, and `*type-wk1` is the only name that
-- answers whatever is held down.
--
-- Can a binding be changed rather than only made and deleted. The page draws a
-- row per binding and every column of it writes straight through, so the spell,
-- the key and the filter each have a writer and each has to refuse in the same
-- words the first press did.
--
-- Is a removed binding gone from both places. The list is the easy half. The
-- attribute on the button is the half that leaks: a macro left on a suffix a
-- later binding lands on is a key casting the spell you deleted.
--
-- Does combat defer rather than error. Attributes and override bindings are
-- both refused under lockdown, so a change made in a fight has to be held and
-- applied when the fight ends.
--
-- And does the list on screen say what is bound. It is the only thing about
-- this feature a player can see, so a row that draws the wrong key or the wrong
-- colour is the feature failing quietly.
