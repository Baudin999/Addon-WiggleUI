-- Blizzard's own frames, held down
--
-- Every switch under `/wui hide` used to be a frame hidden once at login by
-- putting its own Hide where its Show was, and a record that said it had been.
-- That shipped and failed twice in game, so this section is written against the
-- two failures rather than against the switches: the switches were on both
-- times, and reading a setting back proves nothing at all about what is on the
-- screen.
--
-- The failures were the same failure. `SetShown` is resolved in C and never
-- reads the Lua `Show` a strip replaced, so every FrameXML path written that way
-- walked past the hide. `FCF_` uses it on the chat window, which is why
-- `/logout` put the client's chat back; the cast bar mixin uses it on the
-- target's bar, which is why there were two cast bars for one cast. And because
-- the file remembered what it had done, the first frame that got past it stayed
-- past it for the rest of the session.
--
-- So every assertion below is on IsVisible rather than on IsShown, and most of
-- them fire SetShown first. A frame in the attic is allowed to have its own flag
-- turned back on: its parent is hidden and cannot be shown, so the flag is the
-- only thing that moved. That is the whole claim, and IsShown cannot see it.
--
-- What is not measured here: the frames each switch names on the live client.
-- The fixture carries the names this addon was written against, so this section
-- answers for the mechanism and `/wui hide probe` answers for the names.
