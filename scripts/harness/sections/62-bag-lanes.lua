-- The two lanes
--
-- One claim: the equipment piles are drawn in two, what has already bound to
-- you on the left and what has not on the right, and every other pile is one
-- lane of the full width with the same air spent at its right edge instead.
--
-- Its own section rather than part of 55-bags.lua because the subject is not
-- the same. That file asks whether a square is a real bag slot; this one asks
-- where the square landed, which is the one pile shape in the window whose
-- column is not the position in the pile.
--
-- **The binding is read off the client's tooltip and nothing else can answer
-- it.** A link carries no history: the sword you have been swinging for three
-- months and the same sword on a shelf are character for character the same
-- string. So the stub is seeded with the client's own two lines about one slot
-- and not about the one beside it, and what is checked is that the two squares
-- came out in different lanes. Without that seeding the whole split reads as
-- unbound and looks tested.
--
-- What this cannot prove is that the game writes ITEM_SOULBOUND where the stub
-- does. That is 11-tooltip.lua's caveat and it applies to every scan in the
-- addon.
