-- Two claims, and the rest of the file is in service of them.
--
-- The piles are the client's own item classes and nothing here decides them, so
-- what is asserted is the two places the classes are overruled: a grey goes to
-- the bottom whatever class it is, and an item the client has graded nothing
-- stays where its class put it rather than being called junk on a guess.
--
-- And a square is a real bag slot. It is built on the client's own bag button
-- so the click is the client's code, which means the only thing that can be
-- wrong is which slot the square is pointing at, and that is a fact about the
-- parent it was given and the id it was set to. So the click is made the way
-- the client makes it, by calling the global every bag button in the game
-- routes through, and what is checked is that the right item was sold.

-- Putting the half stacks together

-- come out twenty and ten, and three fives come out one fifteen with two slots
-- free under it. Nothing here checks that a drag happened. What is checked is
-- where the items ended up, because the sweep does not decide how many move:
-- it puts one stack on the cursor and drops it on another, and the client
-- splits it. A test that asserted on the two calls would pass on a sweep that
-- aimed them at the wrong pair of slots.
