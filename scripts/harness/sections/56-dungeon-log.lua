-- The adventure guide
--
-- Twelve questions no amount of reading Dungeons/ will answer.
--
-- Does the book survive the bake. Dungeons/Baked.lua is generated out of
-- Questie's databases by a script that runs on a laptop and never in a game, so
-- the one thing nothing else checks is that what came out of it is a table this
-- addon can walk: forty dungeons, two hundred and thirty seven bosses, and a
-- drop list on nearly all of them.
--
-- Does every dungeon in the book have a picture, in the shape the board draws.
-- Dungeons/Sheets.lua is generated too, out of Blizzard's own map tables, and a
-- place the book names that the bake did not reach draws a window with every
-- column right and no map in the middle. The tiles are the other half: twelve
-- of them, one prefix and one to twelve, and a path that came out any other way
-- draws nothing at all and says nothing about it.
--
-- Does every dungeon in the book have a card, and does every card have a
-- painting on it. Dungeons/Art.lua is generated too, out of the 2.5 client's
-- own instance tables, and a place the bake did not reach is a card that is a
-- dark rectangle with a name on it, which looks like a bug rather than a gap.
--
-- Does the window open on the shelf, and does clicking a card become that
-- dungeon and only that dungeon. The left column used to hold every boss in the
-- game and now holds one dungeon's, so the count down that column is the whole
-- of what says which page is up and which dungeon is on it.
--
-- Do all three ways back work. Right click on the boss list, right click on the
-- map, and the button that says where it goes: three paths through two files,
-- and the two gestures are the ones nothing on the screen mentions.
--
-- Does a dungeon with floors get a strip and a dungeon without one not. Both
-- are ordinary and only one of them draws a control, and a strip of one button
-- under a map is furniture that says nothing.
--
-- Is a drop the client disagrees with refused. This is the one that matters
-- most and it is invisible on the screen: an item id that is wrong resolves to
-- a real item with a real icon and a real tooltip, and the only thing that can
-- catch it is the name the bake wrote down beside the id.
--
-- Is a drop the client has never cached still drawn. Most of the column is
-- items you have never seen, and a window that went blank until the client
-- caught up would be blank exactly when it is first opened.
--
-- Does looting a boss place it on the map. Nothing on either client says where
-- a boss stands, so a mark is a thing the addon learns, and the whole feature
-- is the difference between a picture with marks on it and a picture without.
--
-- Does looting a boss teach the book a drop it did not have. Questie's Outland
-- database carries almost no dungeon loot, so for fifteen dungeons this is the
-- only way the right hand column ever fills in.
--
-- Does opening it in a dungeon open it on that dungeon. The join runs from the
-- map id the client hands back, through the floors Dungeons/Sheets.lua baked,
-- to a row of the book, and not one step of it is a name: a match on a name
-- would work on an English client and quietly stop working on any other.
--
-- And does Shift-L open it. The key is an override on a plain button, which is
-- the one shape in this addon that is not proved by anything else: the other
-- three key holders are secure buttons carrying macros.
--
-- Scoped in do blocks, which is what the name budget in scripts/check.sh asks
-- of a section this long: Lua gives one chunk two hundred locals and a section
-- that declares fifty of them at the top is fifty of somebody else's budget.
