-- The places on the map
--
-- One claim: the flight masters, innkeepers, vendors and trainers Questie can
-- draw are a checklist in this addon's panel, and a tick on it is a tick in
-- Questie's own menu, which is what puts the place on this map.
--
-- Its own section rather than part of 54-world-map.lua because that file is at
-- its line limit and the subject is not the same. That file asks whether a
-- frame Questie drew reaches the picture; this one asks whether this addon can
-- make Questie draw one, which is the other direction through the same seam.
--
-- **The flip is a toggle, and that is the whole of what can go wrong.** Questie
-- hands over one function per kind of place and it flips the state rather than
-- setting it, so a caller that calls it on a box already ticked unticks it.
-- Every set here is made twice, and the second is checked on Questie's own
-- profile rather than on this addon's reading of it, because the reading is
-- built from the same entries and would agree with itself.
--
-- **The map is painted on the click.** On the stub the frames are all there
-- at once, so the count after a switch is the count with the place on it. In
-- the game a kind of NPC arrives over a few ticks and lands on the next
-- repaint; Map/Feature.lua says why that is not a ticker.
