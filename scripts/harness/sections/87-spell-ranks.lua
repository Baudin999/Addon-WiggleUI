-- The rank refresh
--
-- Two claims, and the file is in service of them.
--
-- A spell you carry one rank of moves to the best rank you have trained, in
-- every slot it sits in, and nothing else in the bar moves with it. Macros,
-- items, empty slots and a spell already at the top are all left where they
-- are, and so is a rank the trainer has not sold you: 19-spellbook.lua carries
-- Battle Shout rank 3 as a FUTURESPELL, so the top of that name is rank 2 and
-- a file reading the greyed entry would say rank 3 and put a spell on the bar
-- that cannot be cast.
--
-- A spell you carry two ranks of does not move at all, either rank of it. That
-- is the whole of the downranking rule and it has to be silent rather than
-- refused: the count the panel prints comes off the same list the button
-- writes from, so a frozen spell must not be offered as something to fix.
--
-- The write goes through ns.CarrySpell, which is the part that was wrong and
-- could not be seen. This client's PickupSpell takes an id and raises on a
-- name, which is one of the two shapes the call has, so the file used to call
-- it straight and worked here while doing nothing on the other kind of client.
-- The name half of that shim is driven below on its own, because Buttons/
-- Layout.lua reaches it with spell names and nothing else in the suite does.
