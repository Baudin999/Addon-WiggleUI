-- The dark behind a screen window
--
-- A screen window has no ground, so what it is written on is the game, and one
-- wash across its own half of the monitor is what makes it a page rather than
-- text scattered over scenery. UI/Window.lua draws it behind the screen flag,
-- off a getter the caller hands over, so this is the library's behaviour and not
-- the character sheet's: every screen window the addon grows later gets the same
-- wash and should be readable by the same checks.
--
-- The sheet is the one screen window there is today, which is why this runs
-- here and reads that frame. It was a block at the foot of 52-gear-page.lua for
-- exactly that reason and it does not belong there: everything else in that
-- file is the page, its rows, its columns, its figure and its readout, and this
-- is the window under all of them. The line ceiling is what noticed.
--
-- Four things about the wash fail silently and all four are here.
--
-- **It must not take the mouse.** The wash is a texture on the window's own
-- frame and that frame answers nothing, which is what keeps the shadow a
-- drawing rather than a surface. It draws and it hovers exactly the same either
-- way, so nothing about looking at it says which one shipped. The floor is
-- IsMouseEnabled on the frame; the check is a press at a point, and the grid
-- below sweeps the whole sheet so that the only thing hanging directly off the
-- frame the pointer ever reaches is the grip, which is the background the sheet
-- is dragged by and is the one surface allowed to be that big.
--
-- **It fades.** A rectangle of shadow that arrives between one frame and the
-- next on a key press reads as a bug, and a fade is the difference between
-- alpha 0 on the frame the sheet came up and alpha 0 forever, which is a wash
-- nobody can see at all. Both ends are read.
--
-- **It stops at the window's own edge.** The other half of the screen is what
-- the sheet was cut down to give back, and a wash pinned to anything but the
-- window's own two corners takes it away again without saying so.
--
-- **It runs the right way.** Solid at the outer edge and gone by the middle,
-- where the player's character is standing. Backwards is a dark rectangle over
-- the game and a clear one over the page, which is worse than no wash at all.
--
-- What this cannot prove: that half a monitor of shadow looks like anything. A
-- gradient is four colours on the corners of a quad and the stub answers what
-- they are without drawing one.

-- And it never answers the pointer
--
-- Every point on the sheet, on a grid: the frame itself must never be what a
-- press lands on, and the only child of it that may is the grip the sheet is
-- dragged by. Written as a sweep rather than as one aimed press because the
-- page under it is redrawn every few weeks and a single aimed point would
-- quietly stop covering anything.
--
-- The sweep also says the grip is everywhere. The sheet used to hand every press
-- it did not want back to the world and it does not any more: while it is up,
-- a press on it either does what the page put there or moves the sheet, so a
-- point that reaches nothing is a hole in the handle.
