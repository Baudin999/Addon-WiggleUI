-- The wait before a square's box, and the hold at a merchant
--
-- Two claims about the bag window, both about what it does not do.
--
-- A square's box does not open on the way in. The pointer crosses a dozen
-- squares to reach the one you want, so the box waits a moment on the square:
-- it is armed on entering, a move inside the square leaves the count alone, and
-- it opens on the frame the wait runs out. Leaving before that opens nothing.
-- What is asserted is each of those frames, driven one at a time through the
-- tick's own function.
--
-- And the squares do not move while you sell. The first paint at a vendor is
-- held, a sale leaves an empty square where the item was, and every other
-- square stays on the point it was laid at. What breaks the hold is asserted
-- too, because a hold that never lets go is a window that cannot draw a
-- purchase: an item landing in a slot no held square points at lays the piles
-- out again, and walking away closes the gaps.
