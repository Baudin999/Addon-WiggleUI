-- Nothing to aim at
--
-- The rung of Buttons/Slot.lua's ladder that Blizzard's own bar does not have.
-- IsUsableAction knows nothing about the target and their button colours off
-- that call alone, so a Flame Shock in an inn drew ready on their bar and on
-- this one. The rung reads one more fact off the client, whether the slot is
-- an attack, and every edge of that fact is driven here: no target, a friendly
-- one, a dead one, where the rung sits against the others, and the two shapes
-- a macro takes.
--
-- Its own section rather than the tail of the square's, because that file is
-- at its line budget and the question here is one the client's bar never asks.
-- It reads the slot the square section left primed and puts it back empty.
