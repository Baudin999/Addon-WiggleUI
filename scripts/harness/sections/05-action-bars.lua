-- The cloned action bars
--
-- The proof the whole part is for: can every bar the player already has, with
-- every key they already have on it, be replaced by squares this addon draws.
-- Four things below cannot be settled by reading Buttons/Bars.lua.
--
--   That discovery reads the client rather than a number somebody typed. The
--   stub has three multi-bars on and one off, so a clone that assumed two bars
--   and one that cloned every name it knows both fail here.
--
--   That the geometry lands on whole pixels. Every square is 27 across because
--   27 is one of the two sizes where a stored icon texel lands on one screen
--   pixel, and the bar around it is that arithmetic and nothing else.
--
--   That each square presses the slot it should in each stance. Bar 1 pages,
--   and the paging happens inside a secure snippet, so the snippet is run.
--
--   That the keys arrive and that the off switch gives everything back. An
--   override that was set and never read back is a key that silently does
--   nothing, and a hidden Blizzard button with no way back is worse than no
--   feature at all.
