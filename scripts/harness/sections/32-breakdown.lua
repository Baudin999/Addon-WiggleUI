-- The breakdown
--
-- Six questions no amount of reading Breakdown/ will answer.
--
-- Do the numbers land in the right slot. The whole file is positional reads of
-- the combat log, and a swing puts its amount where a spell puts its id. A
-- parser that read the wrong slot would file a spell id as a damage number and
-- the table would look populated and be nonsense.
--
-- Is a crit counted as a hit as well as a crit. Crits are a subset of landed
-- hits and not a separate outcome, and getting that wrong gives a crit rate
-- over the wrong denominator, which is the single number this feature exists to
-- report.
--
-- Are the two averages actually separable. Keeping crit damage apart from total
-- damage is the whole reason four counters are stored rather than two, and the
-- claim is that the average normal hit and the average crit both come back out.
-- A blended average would satisfy any test that only checked the total.
--
-- Does a miss keep its type. A dodge and a parry mean different things to a
-- warrior and the store keeps them apart on purpose; a pooled counter would
-- pass every test about miss chance and lose the thing worth knowing.
--
-- Does the level band actually band. The combat log carries no level, so this
-- rests on a cache fed from targets and nameplates, and the failure mode is
-- silent: everything lands in one bucket and every rate is an average of
-- unrelated fights.
--
-- And does the roll up by name join ranks without joining anything else.
