-- The aura rows on the skinned frames
--
-- The client hangs the target's buffs and debuffs off the frame's bottom left
-- corner, lifted by the height of the art that used to sit under the bars.
-- Fitting the frame to the block took that art away and the same lift then put
-- the row inside the gauge. This file used to assert the answer to that, which
-- was to fit the target frame to the block plus the measured lift so the
-- client's own arithmetic landed the icons under the block.
--
-- That is gone. The rows are hidden and the addon draws its own, which is the
-- only shape available once you want to decide where an aura goes: every icon
-- in the client's target row is a child of a secure unit button, an addon may
-- anchor one out of combat only, and the client re-anchors the head of the row
-- on every aura the target gains or loses.
--
-- So the questions changed. They are no longer "did the frame come out the
-- right height" but "are the client's rows hidden, are ours on the sides of
-- the block they belong on, do they run the way the block is mirrored, and
-- does none of it move when a target picks up a raid's worth of debuffs". The
-- one that carried over is that the frame is the block exactly now, on all
-- three, which is what section 15 goes on to take off and put back.
--
-- Measured off the frames rather than read out of Auras.lua's tables, the same
-- way 06-debuff-row measures the bar's icon row. All four rows are named
-- globals for exactly this reason.
