-- The pin
--
-- Six questions about a list this addon keeps rather than about the log the
-- client hands over, which is why none of them belongs in the section above.
--
-- Does the gesture reach it. Shift left click on a row, driven through the
-- row's own button, because the modifier is read off the client inside
-- UI.List's handler: a window that hung the pin on Select would pin nothing at
-- all on the quest you are already reading, which is the row a player aims at.
--
-- And does a repaint not. Every paint hands the list the id it is already
-- showing, so a pin fired on that path would pin whatever you were reading
-- every time an event moved the log. It is asserted with shift held down,
-- because that is the state the failure needs.
--
-- Does the pin survive a turn-in. Handing one in takes every index under it up
-- by one, which is the reason the store is keyed on the quest, and a store
-- keyed on the index passes every other assertion in this file.
--
-- Is it uncapped. The client's own watch list holds five, and holding what you
-- put in it is the whole argument for this being ours.
--
-- Is the client's list left alone. AddQuestWatch is the call this addon
-- stopped making, so what is counted is every write over the whole run rather
-- than a state read at the end: a single write from anywhere fails this.
--
-- And is it drawn where it can be seen. A pin nobody can find is a preference,
-- so the two drawings are asserted off Window.Rows: the group above the zones
-- and the mark on the row. The group is the half that matters and the half a
-- reader cannot check, because a group in pin order and a group in log order
-- are the same picture on the day you pin them in log order.
