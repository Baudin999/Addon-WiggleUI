-- The sub-piles and the quest lanes
--
-- Three claims. A pile the client files too much under is cut at the subclass,
-- one sub-pile per subclass under the client's own word for it, and the items
-- in one run by their level. The quest pile is drawn in two lanes on a fact
-- that is not the binding: what a quest in your log wants on the left, in the
-- order the log lists the quests, and what nothing in your log wants on the
-- right. And a session with no Questie in it gets the quest pile in one lane,
-- because "cannot say" is never a suggestion to throw something away.
--
-- Its own section rather than part of 62-bag-lanes.lua because the subject is
-- not the same. That file asks where a square landed when the pile splits on
-- the tooltip; this one asks what the rows are, which is the one thing about
-- the window that used to be exactly the pile list and is not any more.
--
-- **The fifth bag.** Every scene before this one is written against the four
-- bags 55-bags.lua describes, and the piles those hold are each one subclass
-- wide, which is the case where nothing here is reachable. So a fifth bag is
-- stood up with two kinds of cloth, an ore, two totems, a pet and one more
-- quest item, and taken down again at the end.
