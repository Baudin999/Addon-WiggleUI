-- The line the client owns
--
-- Three questions, and none of them can be answered by reading Chat/.
--
-- Whose frame do the characters go into. `/logout` ends in Logout(), and the
-- client refuses Logout() from any call stack an addon has been in. A field of
-- the addon's own puts a function of the addon's in that stack, so the press
-- that finished the line came back as a red line naming WarriorKit rather than
-- as a character logging out, and no arrangement of secure buttons and override
-- bindings ever got that down to one press. The fix was to stop building a
-- field. This section reads back that the window types into ChatFrame1EditBox
-- and that its OnEnterPressed is still the one the client set.
--
-- Whose keys open it. Both chat keys were the window's for a while, bound onto
-- buttons of its own so that enter opened the line down here rather than the
-- invisible one behind it. That is what cost the first press: a key bound to a
-- button of ours opens the line from a script of ours. Nothing is bound now,
-- and the readback is that nothing is.
--
-- Does the room's slash survive the open. The client activates the field and
-- then writes what the key asked for, which for enter is an empty string, so
-- anything written while the field was activating is blanked a moment later.
-- Chat/Field.lua writes it again off the blanking. From a chair the two
-- versions are one line that reads `/p ` and one that reads nothing at all.
--
-- Split out of 29-social.lua for the reason 41-voice.lua was: the social part
-- is the rooms and what you read in them, this is the field underneath, and the
-- two together were over the eight hundred line budget.
