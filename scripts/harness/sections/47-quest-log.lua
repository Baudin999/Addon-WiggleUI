-- The quest log
--
-- Five questions no amount of reading Quests/ will answer.
--
-- Does the flat run of rows become zones. The client hands the log over as
-- headers and quests in one list, and a model that got the fold wrong would
-- draw a column that looks right until a zone with two quests in it puts the
-- second one under the wrong heading.
--
-- Does the cursor come back. Every text and reward call in this addon reads a
-- selection the whole client shares, so a borrow that forgot to restore leaves
-- another addon's quest log pointing at whatever this window last drew. It is
-- invisible from inside the window, which is exactly why it is measured here
-- and why the stub models the cursor rather than answering per index.
--
-- Does the left column colour by state. A quest ready to hand in and a quest
-- that will kill you are the two things a log is read for at a glance, and both
-- of them are one table lookup away from being drawn the same grey.
--
-- Do the frames get reused. This client cannot destroy a frame, so a column
-- rebuilt per click either pools its rows or leaks them, and leaking is
-- invisible until an evening of clicking quests has made a thousand frames.
--
-- And does abandoning ask the client rather than itself. The confirmation names
-- the quest the client says it has armed, off the cursor, so the one failure
-- worth catching is the window and the client disagreeing about which quest is
-- about to go.

--
-- Does it thin the crowd out. Forty database rows inside one camp is one place
-- on a map at this size, and a part that drew all forty makes forty frames on a
-- client that cannot destroy one. The stub puts two spawns inside one step for
-- exactly this.
--
-- Does it leave things off. A spawn Questie marks -1 is inside an instance and
-- lands in the corner of the zone if it is drawn; a finished objective's camps
-- are the half of the answer that hides the other half; a zone with no map id
-- is not a zone anything can draw. All three are in the stub's data.
--
-- Does the picture get cropped. A zone is 1002 pixels of art in tiles of 256,
-- so the last column and the last row are part tiles padded out to full size,
-- and drawing them whole puts two black seams through every map in the game.
--
-- And does the wheel work. A zone at the width of one column is three hundred
-- pixels across a place that takes twenty minutes to walk, so the picture is
-- allowed to grow inside a box that does not, and every part of that is a
-- number: the far end, the box against the column, the dots against the
-- picture, and which of the two the zoom belongs to.
--
-- Scoped in a do block for the reason the margin check above is: an indented
-- local is not a name at chunk level, and this file is against the budget
-- scripts/check.sh holds every section to.
