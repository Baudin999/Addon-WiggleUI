-- The social part
--
-- Five questions no amount of reading Chat/ will answer.
--
-- Does a line reach the rooms it belongs in, and only those. The whole feature
-- is a routing decision made once per message, and the two ways it can be
-- wrong, everything in one room and nothing in the group's, look identical in
-- the source and identical on a screenshot of an empty window.
--
-- Does the room you are reading decide where the line you type goes. That is
-- the redesign in one sentence, and it is one thing in three places: the slash
-- the field is filled in with, the note above the log that says what enter will
-- do, and the send itself.
--
-- Does the claim on Blizzard's frames come back off. It is a filter added to a
-- FrameXML list, and a filter that is added twice or never removed is a chat
-- window that goes quiet and stays quiet until a reload.
--
-- Does hiding Blizzard's window put it back. That one has teeth: with the
-- window hidden and the forward broken, every line of loot, experience and
-- addon output in the game is drawn nowhere at all.
--
-- Voice is not one of them any more. It is a Battle.net service rather than a
-- chat room and it is 41-voice.lua now, which is what took this file back under
-- the eight hundred line budget.
--
-- Nor is the enter key. What happens when you type a line the client will only
-- run itself is the binding layer rather than the social part, and it is
-- 45-chat-keys.lua, which is what took this file back under that budget the
-- second time.
--
-- And does a client that refuses a ScrollingMessageFrame, or refuses one of the
-- two spellings of its insert mode, cost the log rather than the window.
