-- The loot feed
--
-- 31-feeds.lua is what a feed is: a ring, an offset into it, rows that do not
-- move and a tooltip on the row under the cursor. Both feeds are that file and
-- neither of them is this one.
--
-- This is the half that is only ever true of loot. Seven questions, and none of
-- them can be answered by reading Feeds/Loot.lua.
--
-- Does the column give the screen back. The loot feed ships with no word over
-- it and no line round it, and the thing that goes wrong there is not the
-- setting: it is a strip that stops being drawn without the rows moving up,
-- which is a band of empty window that looks exactly like the bug it is.
--
-- Does one number move three things. The icon is a setting, the row is the icon
-- plus two, and the frame is the rows; write two of the three and you get a
-- column whose rows overlap or whose last row hangs out of the bottom.
--
-- Does everything that drops get a row. There is nothing over the column that
-- decides what is drawn: a grey and an epic both land, and a quest item and a
-- linen stack beside it are both on screen.
--
-- And is an item's hover worth opening. A vendor price the client will give you
-- per item and never per stack, a quest item that is the same white as a stack
-- of linen until something says otherwise, and a price out of somebody else's
-- addon with that addon named beside it.
--
-- Does a repeat land on the row it is already on. Twelve bandages off one
-- corpse is one row and a number that climbs, and the arithmetic under it is
-- what a reading cannot check: the total, the pickups behind it, the looter it
-- may not fold across, and the minute after which it is a different afternoon.
-- Coin is the same question with no link to ask it with.
--
-- Is the column read against something the addon painted. The panel is gone and
-- each row carries a gradient that has to end where the text ends, because a
-- wash the width of the row is the panel again with a fade on one side.
--
-- And does the row say why you want it. The middle column and the ring are one
-- answer out of Need/Need.lua, and the half a reading cannot settle is that a
-- row which folded six of something reads the count as it stands now.

-- without the rows moving up is a strip of empty screen where a heading

-- the loot feed's shipped 15 as a black bar under thirteen rows.

-- Why the row matters
--
-- The dim middle column is Core/Need.lua's phrase and the ring round the icon
-- is its colour, and the point of them being one answer is that they cannot
-- disagree: a row reading `4/8` in the green a reagent is drawn in is a row
-- saying two things about one item.
--
-- Only a quest count reaches the column, and the reason is a measurement:
-- "Leatherworking" is 104 units in the shipped face at a row's text size and
-- this column is 48 and is never handed more than 81. So a reagent is a green
-- ring and a word on the hover, and the row never draws part of a word.
--
-- 82-need.lua is where the answer itself is held to its order and its cache.
-- What is asserted here is the half only a row can be wrong about, which is the
-- fold. A row that folded six bandanas is showing a count that moved while it
-- was folding, and a note written once on the arrival that opened the row would
-- tell you to keep six more of something your log has stopped counting.
