-- The experience and reputation rails
--
-- Two bars along the bottom of the screen, and almost everything worth checking
-- about them is a state the client puts them in rather than a pixel. So this
-- section drives the fixture through the five: partway through a level with a
-- rested pool, the same level with the pool spent, a level landing between two
-- readings, the level cap, and a character watching no faction.
--
-- What is asserted, in the order it is written:
--
--   The shape. Two rails stacked with the gap between them, the frame exactly
--   as tall as what is in it, and both of them on the pixel grid.
--
--   That a rail with nothing to say is not there. The frame is the height of
--   one rail at the level cap and the height of one rail with no faction
--   watched, and there is no frame at all when both are true. A bar drawn empty
--   would be a claim about a character who has run out of things to earn.
--
--   The rested pool, which is the one region here that is placed by hand. It
--   starts where the fill ends and it is clamped at the end of the level,
--   because a week away is a pool bigger than the level and drawn unclamped it
--   would hang off the end of the rail.
--
--   The clock, which is this addon's arithmetic and not the client's. It is
--   kept per level in the character's saved variables, so what is asserted is
--   the saved numbers themselves rather than an answer a local could give: a
--   gap longer than the idle cap counts as the cap, a level up throws the tally
--   away, and the logout writes the last stretch down.
--
--   Both shapes of the watched faction. The older clients answer five values
--   and the newer ones a table with different field names, and this addon ships
--   for a client where it is genuinely either. The fixture starts with the
--   first and this section installs the second.
--
--   That nothing here runs on a ticker. Every other readout in the addon draws
--   on one; this one is asserted not to have one, because that is the claim the
--   file's head makes and the reason none of its functions is in check.sh's HOT
--   list.
