-- Back to the shipped defaults
--
-- ApplyDefaults fills in a setting that is missing and leaves one that is
-- present alone, which is right for a setting arriving in an update and wrong
-- for a release that moves a default. The player who has run the addon longest
-- is the one whose account file has a number written against every key, so it
-- is the one that never sees a new layout. This is the way back, and it is the
-- only control in the addon that throws away every setting at once.
--
-- What is asserted, in the order it is written:
--
--   That a default handed out for writing is a table nobody else is holding.
--   Eight resets used to write an anchor out longhand for exactly this reason
--   and every one of the eight had gone stale; DefaultCopy is what replaced
--   them, so the aliasing it exists to prevent is checked both ways, on the
--   copy itself and on a restore that follows a drag.
--
--   That every feature's own reset hook writes the registered default and not
--   a literal beside it. Run from a clean slate, `/wui reset` must move nothing
--   at all, and the moment any reset carries its own copy of a number this
--   fails with that part named by the count.
--
--   That the count is the count. Move settings, and DefaultsMoved says how
--   many; restore, and it says none and returns the same figure.
--
--   That the screen the addon ships with is the screen a reset lands on.
--   Core\Shipped.lua is a capture of one install rather than a set of
--   authored numbers, and every key in it is read back off the reset.
--
--   That the records survive. Every key in Core's KEPT list is something the
--   addon wrote down rather than something anybody chose, and a reset that
--   deleted a gold ledger or a group would be a reset nobody presses twice.
--
--   And both surfaces that reach it. The typed word reports on its own and
--   only writes on `yes`; the button on the Settings page arms on the first
--   press, does it on the second, and disarms when the window is shut. Neither
--   applies anything itself, so the run that proves the work happened is a
--   count of how many times the interface was asked to build again.
