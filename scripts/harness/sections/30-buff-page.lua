-- The buff nag's page
--
-- Where the drag is. The row is drawn again on the options page, as the two
-- lines it will draw, and the lines are sets: a spell off the spellbook lands
-- on the line it was dropped on and stays on any other it was on, a square
-- dragged onto the other line is on both, a square dragged off comes off that
-- line alone, and off its last line it turns up under the row where a right
-- click puts it back.
--
-- And the click. A nag square is the one thing on screen you are certain to be
-- looking at when you decide a nag is wrong, so it opens the window on the
-- row's own page rather than on whatever page the window was last left on.
--
-- Its own chunk rather than the tail of 30-buff-nag.lua, because that file was
-- at the harness's own ceiling for names and lines, and the page is a subject
-- of its own. It reads what that section left behind: an orc warrior, both
-- hands bare, in a fight.

-- Five claims. A spell off the spellbook dropped on a line lands on that line.

-- the cursor out of a square here and the button coming up over a line is
-- what a drag means. Dragged off, it comes off the line it was lifted from and
-- no other, and off its last line it is under the row. Right clicked under the
-- row it goes back where it shipped.
