-- The cooldown row
--
-- Five questions, and the first two are the ones that make this a class part
-- rather than a warrior part.
--
-- Is the row built out of the registry. The list this character draws is
-- whatever Class/<yours>.lua wrote down, so every count below is measured
-- against that file rather than written out here, and the section runs
-- unchanged on all five class shapes. A warrior draws four, a mage up to eight,
-- a hunter none at all, and none of those numbers appears in this file.
--
-- Do the three filters each drop a square on their own. A spell the client
-- cannot name, a spell this character has not learned, and a switch you turned
-- off are three different reasons for an empty place on the row and each one is
-- asserted separately, because a row that dropped everything would pass any one
-- of them.
--
-- Does a trinket get on the row for the right reason. The client is what
-- decides: an item with a use effect answers GetItemSpell and one you merely
-- wear answers nothing, so both are worn here and exactly one of them takes a
-- square. That call is reached through the loose global rather than through
-- C_Item, which is the fallback half of ns.ItemSpell's probe.
--
-- Is the row on screen when it should be. It is up for the whole fight, up
-- after one while something is still recovering, and gone otherwise, which is
-- three states rather than the two the buff nag has.
--
-- And does the tick stay free. Nothing here allocates, and what a countdown
-- costs is measured rather than argued about: the timer string is only built on
-- the ticks where the number behind it moved.

-- Does a spell dragged out of the spellbook land on the line and at the place
-- it was dropped at. This client answers a dragged spell with a spellbook index
-- and the book it came out of, and the row counts by id, so the id has to come
-- back off the book: a page that read the index as an id would put some other
-- spell on the row and look exactly like a page that worked.
--
-- Does a spell the row already knows about move rather than arrive twice, which

--

-- back. That is what replaced the tick box per entry.

-- What the tick costs
--
-- With the clock moving and something on cooldown, which is the row's only
-- moving state.
--
-- Five ticks are run before the count starts and they are the point of the
-- measurement rather than a way around it. The one allocation on this path is
-- the countdown's string, which UI/Ability.lua builds only on the ticks where
-- the number behind it moved; the tick that first drew this square is one of
-- those and every tick after it is the steady state. What the gate is for is
-- the steady state going non-zero, which is what a write nobody guarded looks
-- like.
