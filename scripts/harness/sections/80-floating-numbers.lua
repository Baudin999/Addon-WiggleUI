-- The numbers that float off your character
--
-- ns.Ck.Stream and the part built on it. A stream is not a lane and this file
-- is where the difference is asserted rather than described: a message in a
-- column is re-aimed when the one above it goes, and a number is never re-aimed
-- at all, so its whole flight is a function of how long it has been alive.
--
-- Ten questions, and not one is answerable by reading the files.
--
-- Does a blow land on the right side. Damage is placed by who it happened to
-- and not by who caused it, so what is on the left is the target's health moving
-- and what is on the right is your own. A reader that split on the source
-- instead would look entirely correct until something healed you.
--
-- The two anchors are `dealt` and `taken` and the ids were `mine` and `theirs`.
-- That rename is here rather than in a comment because it was a real inversion:
-- `mine` meant blows landing on me and sat on the right, so every name in the
-- feature said the opposite of what it did and the columns were the wrong way
-- round. Nothing but an assertion that names one column and reads the anchor
-- back can hold that still.
--
-- Does healing go somewhere else, and does it rise. It shipped in the right
-- hand column with the damage you take, on the argument that both are your own
-- health bar moving, and that argument does not survive being looked at: the
-- right hand side is what the fight is doing to you and a heal is the one thing
-- in it that is not. It has its own anchor, it travels up rather than down, and
-- it does not bow. All three are assertions because all three are ways of
-- putting good news where the eye is looking for bad.
--
-- Does a blow that did not land say so. A dodge, a parry and a resist carry no
-- number, and this part skipped them on purpose while the quiet setting took
-- the client's own "Miss" off the target, so nothing on screen said a swing had
-- failed. It is a grey word in the column the blow was aimed at, and it never
-- merges.
--
-- Does a column lean one way. The stream alternates sides per number when
-- nobody says otherwise, which is right for one stream and wrong for two: half
-- of what you land bows across your character towards the other column. Each
-- column names its own lean now, so what is asserted is that two numbers born
-- together in one column bow the same way and the two columns bow apart.
--
-- Do they start above the character. A number falls ninety pixels from where it
-- is born, so an anchor thirty below the middle of the screen spends the whole
-- flight below the feet. This is a default, and a default is the one thing a
-- section can assert about a placing the player owns after that.
--
-- Is a crushing blow gold. It is the one flag here that nobody can check by
-- reading: it sits two slots past the critical on a swing, it is sent for no
-- other shape of line, and the symptom of reading the wrong slot is a mob's
-- hardest hit drawn as an ordinary one.
--
-- Do the numbers go large to small and fade while they fall. Both are envelopes
-- evaluated from the fraction of the life elapsed rather than interpolated
-- between two stored ends, which is the whole reason the library is not a tween.
--
-- Does a number grow before it shrinks. This is the one the last three attempts
-- got wrong, and it is not a taste: every channel used to decay from the
-- instant of birth, which is the shape of a thing receding rather than of a
-- blow landing. A number now snaps up past its resting size inside the first
-- twentieth of a second, comes back, holds still for a beat and only then
-- falls. Three assertions, because "it grows" and "it overshoots" and "it holds
-- still" are three different ways of failing to be an impact and any one of
-- them can be lost on its own.
--
-- Does a critical start bigger and outlive a plain hit. That is one style table
-- against another and no branch on the tick, so what proves it is two numbers
-- in the air at once measured against each other.
--
-- Do they curve, and are they scattered. A number bows out of its fall at the
-- halfway point and comes back, and each one is born a step above or below the
-- row. The bow alone was never enough of it: eighteen pixels of it around a
-- sixty pixel glyph is inside the glyph, so two blows a tenth of a second apart
-- still meshed. Now that a column leans, the height is the whole of what keeps
-- two numbers in one column out of each other, so it is asserted on its own.
--
-- Does the same blow twice become one number. A bleed ticking four times is one
-- number carrying the total, and two different spells stay two numbers. This is
-- the behaviour a tween cannot have, because a tween owns its clock and a
-- number merged into has to keep the clock it already has.
--
-- Does the tick allocate nothing and give itself back. The addon spends most of
-- an evening with nothing in the air.
--
-- Are the client's own numbers put away, both kinds of them. Four CVars cover
-- what it draws over your target. The column it scrolls beside your character
-- has no CVar at all: its heals and its hits carry `show` and name no setting,
-- which is why healing was still drawn twice after the CVars went off. That
-- half is a field on the client's own table, so what is asserted is that the
-- addon takes the types it redraws, leaves the ones with a setting of their own
-- alone, gives every one of them back, and finds the table when it arrives late.
--
-- And does off mean off: the switch takes the reader off the combat log rather
-- than turning its handler into an early return.
