-- The cast row
--
-- `grep UNIT_SPELLCAST` returned nothing across this addon until the row
-- existed. The bars replace the nameplate, so replacing it cost the one thing
-- on a plate that says when to press Pummel, and that is what this section is
-- about getting back.
--
-- Everything above measures where the row sits, which is the mistake the debuff
-- row shipped: the squares were in the right place for the whole life of the
-- setting and one of them never came on once. So this asserts a bar comes on, a
-- fill moves, a number counts down, and each of them goes away again.
--
-- The fill is held to the same three statements the swing bar is held to, and
-- for the same reason. It is a moving edge rather than a readout, so on every
-- frame it is given, the drawn position equals the elapsed fraction exactly, no
-- frame repeats the one before it, and every step is the same size. Put a
-- rounding call back in front of the fill and the second of those fails.
--
-- The rest is the failure modes that do not show up in a screenshot: a second
-- cast of the same spell, a cast that runs out between two ticks, a pooled
-- widget carrying somebody else's cast onto the next mob, and a Blizzard region
-- this addon hid on the way in and has to give back on the way out.
