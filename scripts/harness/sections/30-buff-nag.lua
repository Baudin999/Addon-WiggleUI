-- The buff nag
--
-- Two lines that take turns, and the assertions are mostly about the turns
-- rather than about the drawing. A missing sharpening stone must be noticed out
-- of combat and must go quiet the moment a fight starts, because you cannot
-- apply one mid pull. Blood Fury must be silent out of combat and loud in it,
-- because pressing it is only worth saying while you are swinging. And an
-- entry you dragged from the out line to the in line must follow the racial's
-- turn rather than the stone's, because that is the whole of what the drag
-- means.
--
-- The one assertion here that is about a client API rather than about the
-- feature is the off hand. GetWeaponEnchantInfo answers six values on the
-- oldest shape and eight once the enchant's own id went in after the charges,
-- and on the eight value shape the main hand's enchant id sits exactly where
-- the six value shape puts "the off hand has an enchant". It is a number, and a
-- number is truthy. A parser that guessed the stride would report an enchanted
-- off hand forever, silently, on whichever of the two clients answers the shape
-- it did not guess. So the stub is driven in both shapes and the off hand is
-- read in both.
--
-- The shield is the other half of that: a shield takes no stone and a tank
-- holding one must never be nagged about it. That is the client's own
-- OffhandHasWeapon and not a reading of the slot, and the slot is filled with a
-- shield here to prove the difference.
