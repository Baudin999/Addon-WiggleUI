-- The purse
--
-- Feeds/Purse.lua is money for the loot feed: the session's takings on the
-- right end of the feed's header, and the ledger on a panel behind them. Its own
-- section rather than a corner of 31-feeds.lua, because none of this is about a
-- column of rows: the feed could be deleted and every question below would
-- still be worth asking. The panel's motion is 81-purse-drawer.lua, under the
-- sections that need the tween tick left alone.
--
-- Does an unvouched zero stay out of the ledger. This one is not hypothetical
-- and it took two goes. It shipped, and it recorded an alt carrying sixty three
-- gold as carrying nothing; the first fix guessed which moment was answering 0,
-- guessed wrong, and recorded both characters as broke. GetMoney answers 0
-- while the client is still assembling the character, and 0 is a number you can
-- really be holding, so no amount of picking the right event settles it. Only
-- PLAYER_MONEY vouches for a zero, and that is what is asserted.
--
-- Does the header carry the takings, in the heading gold, and does it stand up
-- on a feed that ships with no title. The loot feed has no word over it, so a
-- header that only came up for a title would take the figure away with it.
--
-- Does the account total mean the account. It is the one number here the client
-- cannot be asked for: every other character's gold is something the addon
-- wrote down, and the two ways to get it wrong are counting this character
-- twice and counting the row it was written down at instead of the money it is
-- holding now. Both look right on a fresh install with one character on it.
--
-- Does the rate refuse to answer while the span is too short. The first coin of
-- a session over four seconds is a true number in the millions, and a panel
-- that prints it once per login is a panel nobody believes again.
--
-- And does switching it off give the header's end back to the count, and the
-- height back on a feed with no title.
