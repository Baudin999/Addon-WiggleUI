-- Three questions, and only the first of them is about pixels.
--
-- Who ends up in which slot. That is the whole item: the order is a role band
-- and then a name, decided out of four sources that disagree, and recomputed
-- out of combat and nowhere else. Every roster below is the same six people
-- with one thing changed, so what is read is the change and not the scene.
--
-- What one block draws. Class colour on the health fill, the power colour for
-- the power type, no rail at all for a member the client answers no maximum
-- for, and Blizzard's own role art at the quadrant that is that role. All four
-- were invisible in review, because each is a value that reaches a widget
-- through three files. What it costs is the third question: a tick over four
-- blocks that allocates nothing, which is what the HOT list holds Member.lua to.
--
-- What this cannot prove is the header. It is FrameXML's, 09-group.lua models
-- it, and a model that is wrong is a test that passes over a client that does
-- not. It was wrong once, at the gate that ignores a hidden header.

-- at all, which is the member who has to draw no rail rather than an empty one.
-- Each carries a GUID of their own, spelled the same in the party and in the
-- raid: a role resolved out of talents is cached against the GUID, so a fixture
-- that handed the same person a new one on the way from party2 to raid5 would
-- be asserting that an inspect is forgotten every time the group changes shape,
-- which is the opposite of what the file claims.
