-- The world map
--
-- Eleven questions no amount of reading Map/ will answer.
--
-- Does the column come out of the client's own tree. Every zone in the game is
-- a walk over C_Map rather than a list written down, so a walk that stopped at
-- the wrong node draws a column that is empty, or one continent short, and
-- looks deliberate either way.
--
-- Is it sorted. The client hands its children over in whatever order its own
-- table is in, which is no order at all in a column of thirty names, and a sort
-- that quietly did nothing is invisible next to one that worked.
--
-- Do Questie's markers reach the picture, and only the right ones. This reads
-- another addon's frames, and four of the five things that can be wrong are
-- things that draw too much rather than too little: the minimap's copy of every
-- marker, the ones Questie has hidden, the ones in another zone, and the second
-- register nobody remembers exists.
--
-- Does the footer say who the zone is for. It is the one line on the window
-- that does not come from the client, so it is the one line that can be wrong
-- without anything else being wrong, and all three of its answers matter: a
-- range, a city, and a place the table has never heard of.
--
-- Is your corpse on it. It is the one mark on the picture you are actually
-- walking towards, it comes out of a namespace of its own rather than out of
-- C_Map, and it is drawn as one cell of a sheet of sixty four icons: a mark
-- that lost its crop is the right art in the right place and is a grey smudge.
--
-- Does a drag on a zoomed picture push the picture. The same gesture moves the
-- window when the zone fits its box, so what is being asked is which of the two
-- happened, and both failures look identical in a screenshot: a map that will
-- not be dragged, and a window that walks off the screen when you try.
--
-- Does the wheel zoom, and does stepping to another zone throw the zoom away.
-- The picture is the same widget the quest log's map is and this is the second
-- caller of it, which is the point at which a widget's state stops being
-- private to one window.
--
-- Do the edges of the picture open the zone next door. The client keeps the
-- borders and this window asks for them on a click, so an edge that stepped
-- into the wrong zone, or into a map the column cannot show, or nowhere at all,
-- looks exactly like an edge that worked.
--
-- Does the right button step out to the continent, and is the continent a place
-- the window can actually draw. Left goes in and right goes out, and the row a
-- continent gets at the top of its own group is what the right button lands on:
-- a step out that moved the picture and not the column is a window disagreeing
-- with itself, and one that moved neither is the gesture doing nothing.
--
-- Is your group on the picture. The client places a party member on any map you
-- hand it, which is one call each and nothing worked out here, and everything
-- that can go wrong with it is silent: the wrong people, nobody at all, or a
-- mark that stays where somebody was standing when the map was painted.
--
-- And is Blizzard's map out of the way with the M key pointing here. A hidden
-- map with the key still bound to the client's own toggle is a map you cannot
-- open, which is worse than either window on its own.
