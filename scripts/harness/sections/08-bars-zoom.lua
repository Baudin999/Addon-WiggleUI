-- bars zoom actually scales the bar
--
-- It did not, for the whole life of the setting. Every design number in
-- LayoutWidget was multiplied by ns.Pixel(widget), which on the grid is 1/zoom,
-- and the scale the zoom put on the frame multiplied it straight back. The bar
-- measured 180 by 62 screen pixels at zoom 1, 2 and 3 alike, fonts included.
--
-- Nothing caught it because every assertion in this file was written in the
-- widget's own units, and in those units the bar really does change: it is half
-- as many units at 2x on twice the scale, which is the same picture. The only
-- way to see it is to convert to screen pixels and compare against what the
-- design asked for, which is what this does.
--
-- The hairline is deliberately not scaled. An edge is one screen pixel at every
-- zoom, the rule UI/Window.lua already follows for every rule in the options
-- window, so the box is the gauge plus two pixels rather than the gauge times
-- the zoom.
