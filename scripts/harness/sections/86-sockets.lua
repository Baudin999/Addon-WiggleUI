-- The socketing window
--
-- Three claims, and the rest of the file is in service of them.
--
-- The window is opened by the session and not by whatever started it. Nothing
-- here calls Window.Show: it opens a session on the helmet the way the gear
-- page's shift click does, and what is asserted is that the window came up off
-- the client's own event. That is what lets a gesture this addon does not own,
-- a shift click on a bag square, land in the same window.
--
-- A gem you clicked is not a gem you socketed. The client keeps what is in the
-- hole apart from what you have put in front of it, the window has to draw the
-- second and hold the first, and only apply spends anything. So a click is
-- followed by reading the ruby that is still in the second hole, and the take
-- back is checked on the same hole.
--
-- And the bonus line is the client's answer rather than the addon's. The
-- ordering of the gem list comes off Core/Sockets.lua's colour table and the
-- sentence beside apply comes off the client's `matches`, and this file drives
-- a case where a table that had gone wrong would show up as one and not the
-- other: a purple gem, which fits a red hole and a blue one and is neither.
--
-- The client's own socketing frame is moved rather than hidden, which is the
-- merchant's argument on a different frame: hiding it is what ends the session,
-- and the window would then be drawing three empty holes.

-- not, and a meta fits nothing but a meta hole.

-- The gesture
--
-- The complaint this part came out of: shift-clicking a piece with holes in it
-- did nothing, because this addon's gear page had replaced the one Blizzard

-- makes, and the same square is pressed without shift to prove the swap it used
-- to do is still what an ordinary click does.
