-- The spell book
--
-- One row per spell in place of the client's one entry per rank, and most of
-- this section is about the fold-out: that a rank picked there is what the
-- square is armed with, what a drag picks up, and what the window opens on
-- tomorrow.
--
-- **The grouping is asserted against the fixture's shape, not a count.**
-- 19-spellbook.lua puts Rend's three ranks at indices one, four and five with
-- two other spells between them, and a Battle Shout rank the trainer still
-- has. A reader that grouped by neighbour would draw Rend twice; one that
-- took every entry would draw a square nobody can cast. Both are checked by
-- what the first tab drew, not by how many rows it drew.
--
-- **The secure half is read back off the square.** What a press would cast
-- is the spell attribute, and the fixture's ids are what that attribute is
-- compared against, so the claim is that the pick reached the button the
-- client reads and not only the label beside it.
--
-- **A fight refuses the pick and the end of the fight lands it.** The square
-- is a protected frame and its attributes cannot be written in combat, so the
-- pick is held and the foot says so, and PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED is what arms
-- it. Modelled with the lockdown stub swapped for a moment, the way section
-- 21 does.
--
-- What this cannot prove: that the client agrees a press on the square casts
-- the id in the attribute. 14-secure.lua models the macro half of a secure
-- click and nothing of the spell half, so the attribute is as far as the
-- harness can follow it.
