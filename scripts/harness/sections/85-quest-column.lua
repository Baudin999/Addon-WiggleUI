-- The addon's own quest tracker
--
-- Four questions no amount of reading Quests/Column.lua will answer.
--
-- Does the scope move when you walk. The tracker is the quests the client filed
-- under the place you are standing in, and the whole of that is one string
-- compared against another. Both come off this client, so a comparison that had
-- drifted onto an area id, a map id or Questie's name for the zone would still
-- draw a column: it would draw the wrong one, in the one place a reader has no
-- way to check it, and only ever in a zone nobody wrote the fixture for.
--
-- Does a header that is not a place take everything off it. The client's log
-- header is a sort category rather than a zone, so standing somewhere no header
-- names has to leave an empty tracker rather than the last zone's quests, and
-- an empty tracker is hidden rather than drawn as a rectangle of shade.
--
-- Does the drawing follow the model. Column.Quests answering two quests and the
-- column drawing one is a whole class of bug that reads correctly from inside
-- the file, so the rows are counted off the frames rather than off the list.
--
-- And does a click reach the window. Clicking a row is Quests/Tracker.lua's
-- existing swap arriving from this addon's own frame instead of Questie's, and
-- the failure worth catching is the one that already shipped once: the gesture
-- going to Blizzard's log in the attic rather than to the window that is
-- actually on the screen.
--
-- Everything this moves is put back at the foot of the file: where you are
-- standing, the tracker switch, the lock, the pin on one quest and the whole of
-- the log.
