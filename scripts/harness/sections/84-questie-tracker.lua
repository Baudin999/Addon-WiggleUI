-- Questie's tracker, switched off by its own hand
--
-- One claim: the switch owns the state, the state lives in another addon's
-- saved variables, and the two ends agree after exactly one call.
--
-- **Nothing here is hidden and nothing is re-parented.** The fixture's Enable
-- and Disable are the only way Questie's setting moves, so an implementation
-- that reached for the tracker's frame instead would fail every count below
-- without a single assertion about a frame. That is deliberate: a hidden frame
-- comes back on the first quest Questie hears about, and the failure would be
-- a player's evening rather than a red line here.
--
-- **A call per login is the defect this is written against.** Both of Questie's
-- calls end in ReloadUI, so a file that threw the switch every time it was
-- asked would reload the interface, come back up, and reload again. Every block
-- asks twice and counts the reloads, and that is the assertion that could not
-- be made by reading the code.
--
-- **The asymmetry is the point.** Turning the tracker off is ours to do and
-- turning it back on is only ours if we were the one that turned it off. A
-- player who switched Questie's tracker off in Questie's own options and then
-- ticked and unticked our box must end with the tracker off, and the record
-- that makes that true is the only saved variable this addon keeps about a
-- neighbour.
--
-- **Absent is four states, not one.** No Questie global, the preinit
-- placeholder Modules/VersionCheck.lua leaves in Questie.db before AceDB
-- replaces it, a loader with a tracker module that has neither call on it, and
-- combat. All four are silent and none of them writes anything down.
