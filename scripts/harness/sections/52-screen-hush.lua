-- The HUD getting out from under a screen window
--
-- The wash the section above reads puts the world behind the sheet in shadow
-- and can do nothing at all about the addon's own rectangles, because a
-- cooldown row is a frame over the world rather than part of it. UI/Hush.lua is
-- the other half, and what it answers is per frame: a part goes away for as long
-- as the sheet overlaps it and stays where it is otherwise. Same shape as the
-- wash, which is why it is read here and in the same order: the library's
-- behaviour behind the screen flag, off a getter the caller hands over, and the
-- character sheet is the one caller there is today.
--
-- Six things fail silently and all six are here.
--
-- **The parts have to be registered at all.** A part that builds a rectangle
-- over the world and forgets the one line that registers it draws over the
-- sheet and nothing says so: the sheet still comes up, the other seven still
-- move, and the one that did not looks like a row somebody wanted kept. So the
-- check is by name over the list of every row that has one, and every one that
-- was built in this run has to answer UI.Hushing.
--
-- **A part under the sheet has to go.** Read by placing one on the sheet rather
-- than by trusting where the run happened to leave it. Where these rows sit is
-- the player's, so a section that asserted against the default point would be a
-- section that passes until somebody drags a row.
--
-- **A part clear of the sheet has to stay.** This is the half the old
-- all-or-nothing switch got wrong and the reason the file changed: a sheet
-- pinned to one edge of the monitor was taking the swing timer off the other
-- edge. It is also the half a reader cannot check, because a row that is down
-- when it should be up looks exactly like the feature working.
--
-- **And it has to move when the sheet does.** The sheet is dragged and the rows
-- resize themselves as the fight goes, so the answer is swept off a tick rather
-- than worked out once when the window opened. The tick is beaten here by hand:
-- a sheet moved onto the far row has to take it away and give the near one back
-- without anything else being called.
--
-- **The row's own answer has to survive it.** The whole reason this is a hidden
-- parent rather than a Hide is that every one of these rows is driven by a tick
-- that shows and hides it as the fight goes. A mechanism that wrote the child's
-- own flag would be undone on the next tick, and it would also lie to /wui
-- status, which asks the row whether it is up. IsShown before and after has to
-- be the same answer; IsVisible is the one that changes.
--
-- **The unit blocks go by the other route and have to arrive anyway.** They
-- cannot go into a cell: each one is an anchor of ours with a secure unit
-- button inside it, so it is neither reparented nor hidden from Lua in a fight,
-- and a snippet on the guard is what takes it away. That is the half of this
-- feature reading cannot check, which is what harness/client/21-restricted.lua
-- exists for: the body runs in the sandbox, so a snippet that reaches for a
-- call the restricted environment has never had fails here rather than in a
-- pull. The one question the rows do not have is asked here too: the button's
-- own flag is the unit watch's answer and nothing here may write it.
--
-- **And the sheet has to be over them when the setting is off.** Off is for the
-- player who wants his swing timer wherever the sheet lands, and it is only
-- worth offering because the strata answer holds on its own: a screen window
-- sits at HIGH, over every row this addon draws and under every window the
-- player opens.
