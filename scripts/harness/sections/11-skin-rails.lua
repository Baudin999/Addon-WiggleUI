--
-- The inside of the block is laid out by ns.UI.Flow, and this is the check
-- the enemy bars did not have when the same engine handed their gauge a height
-- of one pixel: a node with no size and no grow measures zero, is given a
-- pixel, and draws a bar nobody can read. Every anchor in that layout was
-- individually correct and nothing caught it until somebody measured it.
--
-- So both bars are measured, and against the block rather than against the
-- settings. Health, power and the three hairlines are the block's height. Each
-- bar is the block less the portrait's square and less the pixel the outline
-- draws into. Both start where the square stops, which the mirror puts on the
-- other side of the block.
