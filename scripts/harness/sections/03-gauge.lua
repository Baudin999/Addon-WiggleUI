-- ns.UI.Gauge, on its own, before either of the parts that draw one. A health
-- or power gauge in this addon is a status bar with a flat fill and the spent
-- part of it behind, and it was built two ways in two files that both ended
-- with the same pair of writes.
--
-- Four things are asserted and not one of them is visible in a screenshot. The
-- fill answers no file path, which is the whole of what flat means. The spent
-- part is a fifth of the fill's colour at nine tenths alpha, which is the pair
-- that was typed out twice and is the reason the file exists. An underlay sits
-- under the fill by draw layer rather than by frame level, which is the bug
-- that drew a full target's gauge at 28 percent of its colour. And painting is
-- free, because both callers reach it from a ticker.
