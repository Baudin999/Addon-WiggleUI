-- The zoom page
--
-- Every screen the addon draws, each sized on its own, which is the change this
-- section exists to hold. There was one number for all of them; shrinking the
-- map to sit beside the quest log shrank the quest log with it.
--
-- Four questions, and none of them is answerable by reading the source.
--
-- Is the page the registry. A row per registered screen across the two lists,
-- no more and no fewer, so a part that registers a screen turns up here and a
-- part that stops drawing one takes its row away. A page with a list of screens
-- typed into it is a page that goes stale the first time somebody adds a window.
--
-- Does either list fit. The rows are split into windows and things drawn over
-- the world because twenty three of them with a sentence under each ran to a
-- thousand units of stack in a view that holds three hundred and fifty, and the
-- row you opened the page for was three screens down. A list taller than the
-- view is a control the page technically has, which is the same as not having
-- it, so the height is asserted rather than eyeballed.
--
-- Are they actually independent. Sizing one screen must move that screen and
-- nothing else, which is the whole of what was asked for and the one thing a
-- shared number could never do.
--
-- Does the window survive the top of the range. At 3x the panel wants 452 units
-- of a screen that has 480 of them left after the zoom, so the clamp has to fire
-- and the result still has to be a whole number of units and still has to fit.
--
-- Does the addon tell the truth about the cost. A tenth stop puts a hairline on
-- a fraction of a pixel and the page says so; a whole stop does not and the page
-- says that instead. Both sentences are read off UI.Exact, so asserting on them
-- is asserting the page cannot claim a grid it does not have.
