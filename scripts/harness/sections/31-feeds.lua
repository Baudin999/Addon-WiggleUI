-- The feeds
--
-- Five questions no amount of reading Feeds/ will answer.
--
-- Does a loot sentence come apart the right way. The client hands over a
-- localised format string and the addon turns it into a pattern, and the one
-- way that goes wrong is invisible in the source: "You receive loot: %s."
-- matches the counted sentence as well, so a table that tries it first reads
-- every stack of eight as one item whose name ends in "x8". Both forms are in
-- the stub for exactly this.
--
-- Is the newest entry at the top, and does it stay there. A feed is a ring with
-- an offset into it and there are two ways to get that backwards, drawing the
-- list upside down and scrolling it the wrong way, and both look plausible in
-- the code.
--
-- Does an arrival move what you are reading. Scrolled back into history, a drop
-- has to push the list down under the offset rather than under your eyes. This
-- is the defect that would make the scrollback useless and it cannot be seen in
-- a screenshot, because a screenshot of a feed that jumped and one that did not
-- are the same picture taken at different moments.
--
-- Does the ring actually reuse its tables. The claim in UI/Feed.lua is that a
-- feed in its steady state allocates nothing at all, and the only way to state
-- that as a test rather than as a measurement is by identity: the four hundred
-- and first drop has to land in the table the first one used.
--
-- Does a row answer the mouse with the addon's own tooltip, anchored to the
-- row that was hovered rather than to whichever one was hovered last.
--
-- And does an arrival draw. It used to, on the arrival itself, and in a pull
-- the combat log lands three or four times between two frames of the screen, so
-- thirteen rows were repainted three times for one frame anybody saw. A push
-- marks the column now and the tick paints it. That is a claim about when the
-- drawing happened rather than about what was drawn, so nothing in a count or
-- an entry can see it: what says it is a row read between the arrival and the
-- frame, which is where the two implementations disagree and the only place
-- they do.
