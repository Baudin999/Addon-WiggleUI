-- What the lock reaches, and what it does not
--
-- Twenty three frames in this addon can be dragged. Fifteen of them are the HUD, and
-- /wui lock is what stops you shoving the swing bars off the screen with a
-- misplaced click during a pull. Eight are chrome windows, and locking one of
-- those would be locking a window rather than placing a piece of the HUD: you
-- opened the quest log on purpose and you will close it again in a minute.
--
-- That difference was a Lock(true) called once at build and never a second
-- time, which is a property of a frame written as a call nobody repeats.
-- UI.Placeable takes `lockable` now, and this is the gate on it, because a
-- declared property with nothing asserting it is a comment.
--
-- The failure it catches is quiet in both directions. A window that starts
-- obeying the lock is a quest log you cannot move while the HUD is locked,
-- which is how it will be for anybody who plays locked, which is everybody.
-- A HUD frame that stops obeying it is a swing bar that walks off the screen
-- on a stray drag and never says why.
--
-- Asserted through RegisterForDrag rather than through SetMovable. Both are
-- set, and the second stays true for the life of the frame: taking the drag
-- button away is how the addon actually takes a drag away, so it is the one
-- that answers the question.
--
-- Driven through ns.Each("lock"), which is what /wui lock and the panel's button
-- both call. Reaching into each part's own Lock would be testing twelve
-- functions rather than the one route a player can actually take.

-- session before this, however many times you had moved them, because
-- UI.Placeable has always had the drag and there was nowhere to put the answer.
-- ns.Remember is both halves of it now, and this is the gate on it.
--
-- The failure is as quiet as the lock's. A window that stops writing its spot
-- down looks exactly like a window you have not moved yet, and the way you find
-- out is tomorrow evening, one window at a time.
--
-- The drop is fired at the frame rather than acted out with a cursor. What
-- moves a plain frame is the client, and what the addon does at the end of a
-- drag is read the point back off it, so a stub that moved the frame itself
-- would be checking its own arithmetic. The sheet is grabbed first because a
-- secure drag has no client behind it and its drop reads the grab.
--
-- Every frame goes back where it was and every key is wiped afterwards. The
-- sections below this one open these windows and measure them.

--

-- buried under the page it belongs to fails here rather than passing. And
-- nothing moves the frame by hand: the client moves a plain one and a snippet
-- moves the secure one, which is the half of the character sheet's drag that
-- had never run.
