-- Which spec this is, and what it swapped
--
-- Section 21 asks what class you are and proves the parts that read the
-- registry are built or absent accordingly. This is the same question one level
-- down, and the reason it needs a section of its own is that a spec decides
-- more than a class does: the cooldown row, the debuff row above every mob and
-- the bar plan are all read off it, and all three used to be one answer per
-- class that an alt inherited whether it fitted or not.
--
-- Every check below is written against what the registry says this character
-- brought rather than against a fixed answer, the way section 21 is, so the
-- same file is a gate on all thirteen runs: a warrior run proves fury and
-- protection swap the cooldown row between them, a shaman run proves an
-- enhancement plan does not reach an elemental shaman, and the hunter run
-- proves a class with no file resolves no spec and loses nothing by it.
--
-- The resolver itself is asserted rather than trusted, because it is the one
-- piece of this that a player never sees working: a signature spell outranks
-- the trees, the trees answer for a spec with no signature, and a character who
-- has committed to nothing gets nil and the class's own fields.
