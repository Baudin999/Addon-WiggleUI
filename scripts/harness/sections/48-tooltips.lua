-- The tooltip, as a part rather than as a box
--
-- Every other section that touches a tooltip does it through the thing that
-- opened one: a feed row, a nag square, an action square. That is the right way
-- round and it is why the schema is asserted there rather than here. What none
-- of them can see is the part itself.
--
--   The bands. A tooltip is a head, a body and what everything else in the
--   addon has to say, always in that order, with air between two bands that
--   both have something in them and nowhere else. Every caller used to decide
--   that for itself and no two agreed, which is a defect visible only with two
--   boxes on screen one after the other and invisible in every file.
--
--   There is no fourth band and there is a check that says so. `hint` was one
--   blue line at the bottom of every box naming the switch that silences the
--   thing, and by twenty five call sites it was furniture. A caller that still
--   passes one gets nothing drawn for it, which is what the check asserts:
--   dropping the band without dropping the field would have left a quiet
--   difference between the call sites that had been cleaned up and the ones
--   that had not.
--
--   The hook. A part registers a source once at load and its line lands on
--   every tooltip about that kind of thing, wherever in the addon the thing was
--   hovered. That claim cannot be made from inside the feed that used to own
--   the line.
--
--   The client's own words. UI/Scan.lua points a hidden GameTooltip at an item
--   and reads the font strings back, because the stats are computed inside the
--   game and no API hands them over. Both outcomes are here: a link the client
--   answers about, and one it raises on, which is what somebody typing an item
--   name by hand produces.
