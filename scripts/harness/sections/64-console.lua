-- One claim: a chunk of Lua handed to the runner comes back as the lines it
-- printed, in order, with print put back afterwards whether the chunk ran,
-- raised or never parsed. Everything else on the page is a button that calls
-- the runner, and 16-options-window.lua already walks the page.
--
-- **print is borrowed, and the borrow has to end.** The runner swaps the
-- global out for the length of the chunk. A chunk that raises is the case
-- where a swap written naively stays swapped, and every print in the client
-- after that would vanish into a table nobody reads. So the raise is the case
-- checked hardest here.
