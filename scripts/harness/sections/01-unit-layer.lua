-- The shared unit layer
--
-- ns.Unit, on its own. Two things it promises are not visible in a screenshot
-- and are what everything above it is built on.
--
-- The first is that a colour is a reference. Every ticker in the addon guards
-- its widget writes by comparing what it is about to draw against what it drew
-- last, and for a colour that comparison is table identity, so the same state
-- has to answer the same table every time. A version of this layer that built
-- its answers would look right on screen and would write the gauge, the track,
-- the edge and the threat line five times a second forever.
--
-- The second is who a walk covers. The threat comparison asks who is closest to
-- taking a mob off you, so it has to skip you: counting the player makes every
-- mob you are holding look like it is about to be lost.

-- Contrast
--
-- The palette's one invariant, and the reason it has a shaping pass at all.
-- Every colour this addon fills a bar with is dark enough that Color.paper
-- clears TEXT_RATIO on it, and every short coloured token drawn on one of
-- those fills clears TOKEN_RATIO.
--
-- This is the check that would have caught the bug the whole thing came out
-- of. The player frame drew a white name on the warrior tan, which is
-- 2.4:1, and nothing anywhere said so. The threat amber was worse at 1.6:1.
--
-- Measured rather than compared against the shaped numbers, so it is not the
-- shaping pass marking its own work: Color.Contrast is the WCAG formula and
-- the two ratios are the thresholds, and a fill that arrived by any route,
-- including RAID_CLASS_COLORS for a class the table does not carry, has to
-- clear them the same way.
