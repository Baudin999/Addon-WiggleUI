-- Dropping on the window
--
-- One claim: an item let go of anywhere on the bag window that is not a square
-- goes into a bag. A square is the client's own button and the drop on one is
-- the client's code; this is the other ninety per cent of the window, the air
-- between squares and the headings and the title bar, which used to leave the
-- item on the cursor.
--
-- Three things are asserted, in the order they can be wrong. The item landed
-- and the cursor is empty. It landed in the first bag with room, which means
-- the walk went past three full bags rather than stopping at the backpack. And
-- a drop with nothing on the cursor is a click on the window and nothing else,
-- because the same handler answers a mouse up and every mouse up is not a drop.
