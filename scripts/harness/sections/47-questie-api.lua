-- Questie's declared-stable API
--
-- Three questions, and the first two are about a client this run is not on.
--
-- Does the door stay shut. `Questie.API` is a table on another addon's global,
-- reached without the loader every other question goes through, and the three
-- ways it is not there are three different clients: no Questie at all, Questie
-- v6 with no Public/ folder in it, and a Public/ that does not carry the call
-- being asked for. All three have to answer nil and say nothing, because a
-- quest log that errors on a machine without Questie is a quest log that is
-- broken for everyone who does not use it.
--
-- Does the wait work. Questie flips `isReady` at the end of its own third init
-- stage, which is minutes after login on a cold database, so the callback the
-- window registers at PLAYER_LOGIN sits in a queue until then. What is
-- measured is that it sat there and that the flip ran it: a window that wired
-- itself up to quest updates at login on the assumption Questie was ready would
-- pass every other assertion in this file and be listening to nothing in a real
-- game.
--
-- And does the update reach the paint. It is a second source next to the
-- client's four events, so it redraws an open window and leaves a closed one
-- alone, on the same rule the client's four are held to.
