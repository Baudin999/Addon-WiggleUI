-- The clutter window
--
-- The only thing in the addon with nothing behind it. A grey sold to a vendor
-- is in the buyback tab; an item destroyed here is gone. So most of what is
-- asserted below is the window refusing: a slot that moved under the card, a
-- cursor holding the wrong thing, a client with no delete call, a second click
-- landing on the card that replaced the one you meant. Each of those is a way
-- to destroy the wrong item, and each one has to end with nothing destroyed.
--
-- Three rules fill the list and each one is asserted on both sides. A rule that
-- offers what it should is half the claim; the half that matters is the thing
-- beside it that it left alone, because every one of those is an item somebody
-- would have destroyed. So the green trade good sitting next to two greys, the
-- guild tabard sitting next to a vest of the same age, and the blue of the same
-- level as the green are all in the fixture on purpose.
