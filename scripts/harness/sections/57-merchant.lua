-- The merchant window
--
-- Three claims, and the rest of the file is in service of them.
--
-- The rack is sorted by the same rules the bag window sorts your bags by, which
-- is the whole reason Core/Piles.lua left Bags/Bags.lua. So what is asserted is
-- that a vendor's stock lands in the same piles in the same order, with the
-- same tie broken the same way.
--
-- A card shows what the scan put on it, names it, prices it, and a press on it
-- buys that entry in the vendor's own batch. Every other window in this addon
-- can be wrong about a picture; this one spends money, so what is checked is
-- that the entry the card described is the entry the purchase was aimed at, and
-- that a press buys the number the card said it would.
--
-- And the client's own merchant window is moved rather than hidden. That is the
-- one decision in this part that cannot be recovered from: hiding that frame
-- ends the conversation with the vendor, and everything the addon then draws is
-- an empty rack. What proves it is the guard Comfort/Vendor.lua puts in front
-- of every sale, which reads IsShown on that frame and has to go on answering
-- true with the frame parked off the side of the screen.

-- A press
--
-- Through the client's own click rather than through the card's handler, and

-- and middle buttons to the camera has had which buttons it answers written,
-- and the left one has to be asked for again afterwards or the card draws
-- perfectly, hovers perfectly and does nothing at all when you press it. The
-- harness refuses a click a button is not registered for, so a card that lost
-- its registration fails here rather than in Ironforge.
--
-- What is checked is the entry, not the card: the purse moves by the price of
-- the thing the box on the pressed card described.
--
-- The buttons are the client's own. Right buys, left picks a batch up onto
-- the cursor and a left drag is the same pickup, which is what
-- MerchantItemButton_OnLoad registers and what every vendor since 2005 has
-- answered. For a day the left button bought and the right was handed to the
-- camera, so a right click on the rack did nothing at all.
--
-- And it buys the batch. The client counts a purchase in items rather than in
-- the vendor's own stacks, so asking it for one at a vendor selling water five
-- at a time bought a single water and charged the price of five. The card says
-- 5 in its corner and this is the assertion that the press agrees with it.
