-- The row of what you have out
--
-- Five questions, and the first two are what make this a class part rather than
-- a shaman part.
--
-- Is the row the class file's. Every count below is measured against whatever
-- Class/<yours>.lua wrote into `standing`, so the section runs unchanged on all
-- twelve shapes: a shaman draws four squares, everybody else draws none, and
-- neither number is written in this file.
--
-- Does a class with no plan build nothing at all. Not a hidden frame, not a
-- placeable rectangle, not a ticker: a part that is not for you costs nothing
-- and says why. That is the half a reading of the source cannot settle, because
-- the frame is made inside an event handler.
--
-- Does a slot filling light its own square and no other. The four slots are
-- read by the client's own numbering and drawn in the plan's order, and those
-- two orders are deliberately different, so a row that used one for the other
-- would light the wrong square and look entirely correct.
--
-- Are the empty slots still drawn. That is the whole design of the row against
-- the client's own: a hole keeps its place, so the shape of the row is what you
-- read rather than the names on it. A row that shrank to what is up would pass
-- every other assertion here.
--
-- And is it on the screen when it should be: up in a fight, up afterwards while
-- something is still standing, gone when everything has run out, and up anyway
-- when you asked for that. Plus the tick, which allocates nothing.
