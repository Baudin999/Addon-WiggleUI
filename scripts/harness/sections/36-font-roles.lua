-- What is behind every string in the addon
--
-- UI/Text.lua names three roles and argues for each. Flat over a surface this
-- addon painted and knows the colour of; shadowed over ground it did not paint
-- and cannot predict, which is a spell icon and the chat window; outlined over
-- the world at a size that can carry a rim. scripts/check.sh
-- fails any call that names no role, and that gate is worth having, but it can
-- only see that a role was named. Whether it is the right one is a fact about
-- what is behind the string, and no amount of reading the call answers it.
--
-- This does. Every frame the addon builds is here, every font string hangs off
-- one of them, and every backing texture is a region with an alpha on it, so
-- the question "is there a surface under this glyph" is one the built addon can
-- be asked directly. It is asked twice: once as the addon comes up, and once
-- with every background opacity dragged to zero.
--
-- The second pass is the one that matters and it is the one that caught the
-- fix that went in before it. Three surfaces in this addon are not surfaces:
-- the two feeds and the chat window paint a background whose opacity is a
-- slider, the slider goes to zero, and Feeds/Feature.lua tells the player in
-- writing that the text reads all the way down to nothing. A string on one of
-- those is a string over the world that happens to look like it is not, and it
-- was flat for exactly as long as it took to run this.
--
-- Four rules, and each is a way this has already gone wrong.
--
-- Every string is drawn in a face the addon ships. There are two of those,
-- Media/Sans.ttf and Media/Glyphs.ttf, and UI/Text.lua is the only file that
-- names either. The rule is here because the addon changed face and the only
-- honest way to know a face change reached forty windows is to ask all two and
-- a half thousand strings what they are drawn in. It keeps working after that:
-- a caller that reaches SetFont itself instead of taking a shared font object
-- lands on Friz Quadrata or on Arial Narrow, both of which are legible, so the
-- screenshot looks fine and one panel is quietly in the wrong typeface.
--
-- An outlined string is at least UI.OutlineFloor() tall. A rim costs a pixel of
-- every stroke whatever the glyph is, so under the floor it closes the hole in
-- a 6 and the waist of an 8. This is what the report about the purse's font was
-- looking at, and the two drag captions on the swing bars and the buff row were
-- the same defect nobody had hovered.
--
-- A string with nothing behind it carries a rim or a shadow. Flat over the
-- world is not softer, it is gone. Which of the two it carries is settled by
-- the rule above: over the floor a rim, and under it a rim would close the
-- glyph's own counters, so a shadow is the only thing left. That is the chat
-- window, whose font is a slider from 9 to 20 and whose background is a slider
-- to 0, and it is what this rule used to hold three files exempt from. The
-- exemptions all read the same way - flat is wrong here but an outline is
-- worse, so it stays flat - and all three were the same mistake, which was
-- reading the three roles as a choice between flat and outlined with the
-- shadow spoken for by debuff squares. A shadow spends no pixel of the glyph,
-- so it works at 9 as well as at 20. The allow-list is empty and the rule is
-- the whole policy.
--
-- Nothing is MONOCHROME. It was tried and it broke Arial Narrow's stems. The
-- face has changed since and the rule has not, because what went wrong was a
-- humanist face at eleven pixels with the rasteriser turned off and Noto Sans
-- is another one of those. UI/Text.lua keeps the gravestone; this keeps the
-- gate.
--
-- What is deliberately not checked: that a string with a surface behind it is
-- flat. A shadow over an opaque bar is a defensible choice and UnitFrames makes
-- it on purpose, so the rule that would catch a stray outline there would also
-- fail every number on a debuff square. 12-debuff-square-size.lua checks that
-- per widget, where the surface is known by name.

--
-- Empty, and it should stay that way. It held three files, every one of them
-- excused from the bare rule for a reason that turned out to be the rule being

-- Three things count as something to stand on, and the two that are not a

--
-- A colour the addon painted over the whole frame, near enough opaque. That is
-- every panel and window surface in the addon and is what the rule is mostly
-- about.
--
-- Art, meaning a texture set from a file path. A spell icon is set that way and
-- carries no alpha at all, and it is cropped rather than pinned corner to
-- corner, so a coverage test throws it away. Every shadowed number in the addon
-- is standing on one: without this the aura square's timer and count read as a
-- hundred and sixty eight strings over the world.
--
-- A status bar's own fill, which the client keeps off the region list where
-- GetRegions cannot see it. The four strings on each skinned unit frame sit on
-- Blizzard's health and power bars, which is a surface, and it is the client's
-- rather than ours.
-- A colour that is not pinned corner to corner still counts if it runs the
-- width of the frame and is taller than the glyph standing on it. That is the
-- title bar: a window's chrome is a band across the top, it is opaque, and
-- Window:SetOpacity does not touch it, so a window dragged to nothing still has
-- a strip of chrome under its own title.
--
-- The two halves are what keep this from accepting a hairline. An edge from
-- ns.Outline spans the top the same way and is one pixel tall, and the two down
-- the sides are anchored to one edge rather than across.
