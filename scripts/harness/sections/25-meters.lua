-- The meters
--
-- Four questions, and only the first of them is about drawing.
--
-- Does the frame come up on the grid, in the size the settings ask for, and
-- does changing a setting reshape it without building a second copy of it. A
-- frame cannot be destroyed on this client, so a pane rebuilt per setting
-- change is a leak that never shows up in game and never stops growing.
--
-- Does the combat log parser read the right slot. The client hands over
-- sixteen values in a fixed order and the amount is in a different one for a
-- swing than for a spell, so the whole of that half is positional and a stub
-- that answered a named table would prove nothing about it.
--
-- Does the group filter hold. The log carries every fight in range: the other
-- party's pull, both sides of the duel by the mailbox, and every mob in the
-- pack. A pet's damage has to land on its owner and a stranger's has to land
-- nowhere, and those two are the same test from opposite ends.
--
-- And does a segment start and stop when a fight does, rather than when a
-- bleed ticks. The tail of the last pull opening a new segment would replace
-- the numbers you are still reading with two ticks of damage, which is the
-- kind of defect nobody reports because it looks like the meter resetting for
-- some reason of its own.

-- a black chat window and which six of the nine classes are far too light to
-- be a background for, and then wrote the name on that bar in the same
-- colour, which is one to one. Sneakyman is a hunter, and the hunter is the
-- case the screenshot came from: a pastel slab with an invisible name on it.
--
-- The floors themselves are gated in 01-unit-layer.lua, over every fill and
-- every token in the palette. What is gated here is that the meter is using
-- them: which of the two colours in a class pair goes on which surface, and
