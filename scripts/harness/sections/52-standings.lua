-- The standings window
--
-- Reputation was the character sheet's fourth tab and is a window of its own on
-- `/wui reputation`. Character/Reputation.lua did not change a line for the move,
-- so what this section is about is the host: that nothing exists until somebody
-- types the word, that what comes up draws the same list the tab did, and that a
-- window nobody has open is not walking the client's faction table.
--
-- **Built on the first open, which is the half that is easy to lose.** Every
-- window in the addon waits for its first open except the character sheet, and
-- the sheet is the file this one was cut out of. Copying its lifecycle would
-- have been the natural mistake: a window built at login, a faction walk paid
-- for by every player whether or not they ever type the word, and nothing
-- anywhere saying so. So the first three checks run before anything in this file
-- has asked for the window.
--
-- **The list is read through the pane rather than through the module.** What the
-- module answers is 52-gear-page.lua's shape of question; what is asserted here
-- is that the answer reached the screen, which is a different failure and the
-- one a host can cause on its own.
--
-- What this cannot prove: that a faction bar looks like anything. The fraction
-- is a width and the standing is a colour, and the stub answers about both
-- without drawing either.
