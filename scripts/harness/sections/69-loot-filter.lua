-- The loot filter
--
-- Fast loot takes everything, which is what you want on a pull and not what you
-- want on the twelfth corpse of an old dungeon. The filter is the sentence the
-- player says out loud put into settings: cloth, greens and up, mining, and
-- what my professions use.
--
-- The assertions that carry the weight here are the negative ones, the way they
-- are in the chores section above. A filter that takes too much is a bag you
-- clear by hand, which is where this started; a filter that takes too little
-- has walked past something you wanted and there is no way back to that corpse.
-- So every pass reads which slots came home rather than how many, the two slots
-- that may never be refused are asserted under every combination of rules, and
-- the master loot guard is asked again with the filter on top of it, because
-- the filter must not be able to talk the addon into a slot the master looter
-- has to hand out.
--
-- The corpse this section stands up is a longer one than the four slots every
-- other section counts, one slot per rule, and it is put back at the foot of
-- the file.
