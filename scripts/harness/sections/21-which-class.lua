-- Which class this is, and what it brought
--
-- Ten of the twelve parts do not care what you are. The ones that do read facts
-- off ns.Class rather than asking about a warrior, and a class that registered
-- no such fact has to be absent rather than merely quiet: a hidden charge button
-- is still a secure frame holding a key override, and a hidden world marker is
-- still a nameplate scan twenty times a second.
--
-- Every check below is written against what the registry says this character
-- brought, never against a fixed answer, so the same section is a gate on every
-- run: the warrior run proves the parts are built and the other runs prove they
-- are not. That is what makes it worth running the harness as more than one
-- class, and it is why this file takes the class on the command line instead of
-- flipping one here. Both halves are decided once, at PLAYER_LOGIN.
--
-- The CVar is the one worth stating plainly. Action targeting exists to serve
-- the charge button, so on a class without one the addon must leave the client's
-- own setting exactly as it found it, and "the addon does nothing" is only ever
-- provable by reading the thing it would have written.
