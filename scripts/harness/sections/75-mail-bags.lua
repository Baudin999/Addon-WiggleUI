-- Right click in the bags, onto the letter
--
-- The client's own way of attaching something and the only one anybody uses.
-- Driven by clicking a square of this addon's bag window with the mail window
-- open, the way the player does, because the take is a registration and an
-- OnMouseUp on that square, and a test that called the addon's own handler
-- would be testing nothing.
--
-- Every check here is about where the stack ends up. A click the addon claimed
-- and then handed back is the failure worth catching: the client's answer to a
-- right click on a bag slot is to eat, equip or sell what is in it. And the
-- square's own registration is read, because that is the mechanism: the right
-- button off it while the letter is open, so the secure OnClick never runs, and
-- back on it when the letter closes, so a scroll reads again.
