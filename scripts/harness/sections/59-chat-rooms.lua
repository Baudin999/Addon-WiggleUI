-- Five things the window grew after the history did
--
-- Does the rail follow the picture. The setting moves one number and three
-- rectangles are laid out off it: the picture, the row it sits in and the
-- column of them. A picture drawn at twenty in a row still eighteen tall is
-- clipped at the top and bottom, and the rail's width is still what the theme
-- said, so nothing that measures the column would notice.
--
-- Does closing a conversation close it. Three places have to agree: the rail
-- stops drawing the room, the log is handed back, and the saved record stops
-- naming the person, or the login that brings last night's conversations back
-- brings the one you closed.
--
-- Does the copy box hold the room. The client has no clipboard call, so what
-- can be asserted is that a field holds the keyboard, holds the log with its
-- colour codes taken off, and is selected whole.
--
-- Does a line of the addon's own go to its own room. It arrives through the
-- same hook a loot line does and the prefix is the whole of what tells them
-- apart, so the assertion is one of each, each in its own room and not in the
-- other's.
--
-- And does a row say which button and which modifier pressed it. The rail is
-- the oldest UI.List in the addon and the gesture is the widget's, so it is
-- asserted on a column built here: the two arguments have no reader until a
-- quest is pinned with them, and an argument nothing reads is an argument that
-- can be wrong for a release. The case that pays for the block is a click on
-- the row already selected, which Select refuses and which a player aiming at
-- the quest they are reading makes constantly.
