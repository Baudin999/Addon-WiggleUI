-- The swing timer, as a person sees it
--
-- The section above asserts the arithmetic and every one of its assertions
-- passed while the feature was unusable in game. Two things were wrong and
-- neither is arithmetic.
--
-- The bar moved in steps, and it took two goes to find out why, because there
-- were two throttles on one edge and removing the first left the second.
--
-- The first was a 20 Hz ticker. The second was the rounding: the fill was
-- snapped to a whole pixel, so it could only change value 53 times a second at
-- the shipped width however often the tick ran. A 144 Hz screen drew the same
-- position on 91 of its 144 frames, and each move was a whole design unit,
-- which is three screen pixels at swing zoom 3.
--
-- No assertion in this file can prove that a bar looks smooth. Smooth is a
-- property of a screen and an eye, and the stub has neither. What can be
-- proved is the property that leaves the client nothing to be blamed for, and
-- it is one sentence: on every frame it is given, the addon hands the widget
-- the exact position the elapsed time puts the edge at. So the fill is driven
-- across a whole swing at two frame rates and three things are asserted, none
-- of which is a tolerance. The drawn position equals elapsed over duration
-- times the width, exactly. The value changes on every frame, with no frame
-- repeating the one before it. And every step is the same size as every other,
-- which is what constant velocity means and what a quantiser destroys.
--
-- The second of those is also the gate on the addon's second pixel rule: a
-- moving fill is not quantised. Reintroduce a Whole() around the fill and the
-- repeated frames come back and this fails. The first rule, that a static edge
-- lands on a whole pixel, is gated by the anchor sweep at the end of the file
-- and by the mark assertions below.
--
-- And the mark moved. It was drawn from a cast time re-measured on every cast,
-- so the number under it changed while the player was aiming at it. The
-- assertion is that several casts in a row leave the mark on the same pixel.
--
-- What is allowed to move it is the swing speed, and that is asserted as the
-- invariant rather than as a percentage: at every weapon speed, the moment the
-- fill reaches the mark is the moment the swing has exactly a cast time left
-- to run. The percentage is the thing that moves; the invariant is the thing
-- that must not.
