-- count that lays out wrong is arithmetic nobody re-does by hand. A ground is a
-- texture nothing reads back. And the two that decide when a bar is on the
-- screen are a macro string handed to the client to evaluate, which is the one
-- piece of this part that is not code this addon runs: a condition in the wrong
-- order is a bar that is up when it should be down, and the only place that can
-- be caught before the game is here.
--
-- A section of its own rather than two hundred more lines in 05-action-bars,
-- and along the seam that file already has. That one is the clone: the slots
-- each square presses, the keys, the paging and Blizzard's own buttons going
-- down behind it. Nothing in here knows what an action slot is.
--
-- Last in the run order, and self-contained because of it. Every section
-- between this one and 05 has been driving the panel, the skin and the meters,
-- and one of them unticks a bar, so the clone is stood up again here rather
-- than assumed. Everything below puts back what it moved: the last thing it
-- does is drop every record and assert bar 1 is the plan's own shape again.
