-- Keeping an open box true
--
-- A tooltip in this addon was built once, at the moment the pointer arrived,
-- and never again. What that costs is invisible on any single hover: it is a
-- threat percentage that was right when you got there and wrong for the rest of
-- the pull, a quest count that does not move when you loot the thing. The
-- complaint it produces is that the addon's tooltips are slow, and they were
-- not slow. They were never redrawn.
--
-- Its own section rather than a block at the foot of 48-tooltips.lua, which is
-- the subject next door and full. What is asserted here is not what a box says
-- but when it is asked again, and the two halves of that are one claim:
--
--   A box is built again when something in it moved. Without this half there is
--   no feature.
--
--   A box is not built again when nothing in it did. Without this half there is
--   a feature that costs a rebuild sixty times a second for as long as anybody
--   reads anything, which is what rebuilding on a tick would have been and is
--   the reason the stamp exists at all.
--
-- The churn reading is the second half measured rather than asserted. A pass
-- that allocates is a pass the collector has to walk later, and the collector
-- runs in the middle of a frame.
