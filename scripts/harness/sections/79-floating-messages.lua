-- Floating messages
--
-- ns.Ck.Animations and ns.Ck.Float, and the first thing built on them, which is
-- a drop sliding in from the right edge of the screen.
--
-- Seven questions, and not one of them is answerable by reading the files.
--
-- Does a message land where it was told to. The two offsets are measured
-- against different things on purpose, one from the screen's edge and one from
-- its centre, and the whole of that arithmetic happens inside Push. A lane that
-- resolved both against one anchor would look right on the monitor it was
-- written on and be off by half a screen on the next.
--
-- Does the column stay a column. Three drops at once are three slots, and the
-- thing that goes wrong is never the first one: it is the third landing on the
-- second because the slot was computed from a constant row height rather than
-- from the rows.
--
-- Does the stagger stagger. A burst has to read as arrivals, which means the
-- second message is still sitting at the edge on the frame the first has
-- already started moving.
--
-- Do the survivors climb. This is the only behaviour here that runs from inside
-- a tween's own completion, which is the tick path, and it is why Ck/Float.lua
-- carries two `hot:` markers.
--
-- Does the walk keep its footing while the list changes under it. A message
-- leaving stops two other tweens from inside a third one's completion, so the
-- list the tick is halfway through indexing loses entries it has not reached.
-- A bag's worth of drops at once is what found that, and what it read as was a
-- Lua error rather than a wrong number.
--
-- Does arming clear the last run. A tween is re-armed rather than rebuilt, so
-- every field of the previous run has to come off, and the way that fails is a
-- fade that drags the frame back across the screen.
--
-- And does the tick give itself back. The addon spends most of a session with
-- nothing moving, and a library that held an OnUpdate open for all of it would
-- charge every part that animates nothing.
