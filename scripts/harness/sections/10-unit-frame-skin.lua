--
-- The same questions as the bars, against the player, the target and target
-- of target. All three are our own frames now, so what used to be asserted as
-- a boundary between our grid and Blizzard's scale is asserted as a rectangle:
-- a secure button on the grid, whole pixels everywhere, a portrait asked for,
-- two bars painted the unit's colour, and a tick that neither allocates nor
-- writes what is already there.
--
-- What the button carries is asserted before what it draws. A block that is
-- placed, measured and painted and cannot be clicked is Blizzard's frame with
-- the art taken off, and the two attributes and the click registration are the
-- whole of what makes it a unit frame rather than a picture of one.
--
-- What this cannot prove is that the game agrees. The secure button's click,
-- the menu behind the right button and the unit watch are all the client's,
-- and the fixture models each from the contract.
