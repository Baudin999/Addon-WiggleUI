-- The talent trees, one talent at a time, and the calls that spend a point
--
-- 06-log.lua answers the three trees as a whole, name and icon and points,
-- which is all the meters and the party frames ever asked. The talent window
-- asks the rest: where every talent sits, what rank it is at, what it needs
-- first, how many points are waiting, and the two calls that change any of
-- that. This file is the client's answer to all of it.
--
-- **Modelled on the anniversary client's shape.** C_SpecializationInfo takes a
-- query table and hands back a record, GetTalentPrereqs answers four values
-- per requirement, and the group is an argument on every call. The older
-- shape, a GetTalentInfo that answers a run of values, is installed by
-- section 67 over this one for a moment and taken off again, the way section
-- 58 stands the tab call on its older signature.
--
-- **Three trees drawn from the warrior's, and not the warrior's.** The names
-- are real so a picture of the window reads as one, but the layout is chosen
-- for what it exercises: a requirement straight down a column across an empty
-- tier, one along a row, one diagonal with a clear route and one whose short
-- route is blocked, a ninth tier so the window is sized for the taller
-- client, and a tree with no points in it so a locked tier is reachable. A
-- fixture that copied the real trees would test whichever of those the real
-- trees happen to have.
--
-- **04-hands.lua's GetTalentInfo stays.** The Slam window's estimate reads a
-- talent through it and the fixture there is shaped for that one question.
-- GetNumTalents is taken over, because the window walks every index and three
-- is not a tree, and the older reader in Swing/Slam.lua walks the same count
-- and finds its talent at the same index it always did.
--
-- What this cannot prove is that the game agrees. Every call answers what this
-- file says, and a wrong field is a test that passes and a window that draws
-- the wrong rim.
