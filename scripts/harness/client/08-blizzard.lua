-- The nine calls a bag is opened and shut through

-- of them are yours to press: B, a bag button on the bar, and the binding for
-- all of them. The other six are the client calling on your behalf, and
-- `OpenAllBags` is the one that matters, because it is what a merchant and a
-- bank do.
--
-- Modelled rather than stubbed away because it is the seam. What the addon
-- swaps in has to be reachable by name at call time, exactly as the client's
-- own keybinding reaches it, so a section presses B by calling `ToggleBackpack`
-- and what answers is whichever function is on the name at that moment. A stub
-- that called the addon's window directly would prove nothing about the
-- takeover, which is the half that can be wrong.
--
-- What the client's own version does is counted rather than drawn. A count
-- going up while the addon claims to be holding the name is the failure this
-- exists to catch: the client's bags opening beside the addon's window.
