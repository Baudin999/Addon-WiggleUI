-- The spell book, every rank of it, and the client's own window
--
-- 03-player.lua answers three book indices, which is all the drag readers
-- ever asked: what a spell dropped on a row is. The spell book window walks
-- the tabs, and this file is the client's answer to that: two tabs, the
-- entries in each, a rank line under every one, a passive, and a rank the
-- trainer has not sold yet.
--
-- **The first three indices are 03-player.lua's, unchanged.** Rend, Thunder
-- Clap and Battle Shout at one, two and three with the ids that file carries,
-- because the buff page, the cooldown row and the mouseover page all drag off
-- those three by index and a book that moved them would move three sections
-- with it. The ranks are appended after them, which is a shape the real book
-- does not have, and it is deliberate: the reader groups by name rather than
-- by neighbour, and a fixture whose ranks sat side by side could not tell the
-- two apart.
--
-- **The ids past the first three are fixture numbers, not the game's.** The
-- window never compares one against anything but itself: an id is what a
-- square is armed with and what a section reads back off it. Nothing here is
-- baked game data and none of it should be copied out.
--
-- **Ranks.lua reads its ranks off this book.** That file walks the tabs and
-- used to be refused at GetSpellTabInfo. With this book under it and the
-- PickupSpell below beside it, both halves of that file run: 87-spell-ranks
-- lays spells into the action slots 05-quests.lua models and presses the
-- button. Three ranks of Rend and two of Battle Shout with a greyed third are
-- what that section counts against, so moving an entry here moves it.

-- The book, seen through GetSpellInfo
--
-- 03-player.lua answers that call off a flat table of ids it names, and every
-- id it does not carry comes back as "Spell6547". That was fine while nothing
-- compared the answer with a book entry. Buttons/Ranks.lua does exactly that,
-- on every slot on your bars: it reads the id out of a slot, asks for its
-- name, and looks the name up in the book it walked. Against the flat table
-- every rank past the first three is a spell of its own with nobody else
-- sharing its name, so nothing is ever behind anything and the whole feature
-- reads as a bar that is already up to date.
--
-- Wrapped here rather than written into that file because the ranks are here.
-- The earlier answer is kept for everything this book does not carry, which is
-- most of the ids in the suite, so the two are one call and not a fork.
--
-- The name direction is the same lookup read backwards, and it is the seventh
-- return. ns.CarrySpell reads the id there when PickupSpell has refused a
-- name, which is the shape Buttons/Layout.lua reaches it in, so without it the
-- name half of that shim has no answer on this client. The last entry wearing
-- a name is the top rank you have trained, which is the rank the live call
-- hands back when you ask it by name.
