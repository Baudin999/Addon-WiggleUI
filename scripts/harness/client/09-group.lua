-- A party, a raid, and the secure group header that draws one
--
-- The stub had no group at all: no party or raid tokens, no
-- UnitGroupRolesAssigned, no GetPartyAssignment, no UnitInRange and no
-- templates of any kind. UnitFrames/Group.lua is a header and an order, so all
-- of that has to exist before a single assertion about it can run.
--
-- Three parts, and the order they are in is the dependency order.
--
--   The roster. One record per member, written by a section and read by every
--   unit call below. Health, power, range and whether they are dead are per
--   member here, where the shipped client answers one constant for everybody,
--   because a fixture that gave every member the same reading could not tell a
--   block drawing its own member from a block drawing the first one four times.
--
--   The unit calls, layered over what 03-player.lua and 06-log.lua already
--   installed. A token this file knows about is answered from its record and
--   everything else falls through, so every section above this one sees exactly
--   what it saw before.
--
--   The header. SecureGroupHeaderTemplate is FrameXML's, so CreateFrame is
--   wrapped: a frame asked for with that template comes back doing the three
--   things the addon leans on. It holds attributes, it makes one child per
--   member and points each at a unit, and it runs the initialConfigFunction on
--   a child the first time it makes it.
--
-- What this cannot prove is that the game agrees. The real header's ordering,
-- its column arithmetic and its restricted environment are modelled from the
-- contract, and a model that is wrong is a test that passes and a client that
-- does not.
