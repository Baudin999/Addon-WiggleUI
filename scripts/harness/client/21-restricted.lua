-- The restricted environment
--
-- A secure snippet is the one part of this addon that reading cannot check.
-- It runs inside the client's restricted Lua, it is the only thing allowed to
-- move a protected frame in a fight, and until this file existed the harness
-- treated it as a string it kept for a section to read back. Two bugs walked
-- straight through that. UI/Placeable.lua's first drag called StartMoving from
-- a snippet, which does not exist in there, and every drag on the character
-- sheet ended in "attempt to call a nil value" out of RestrictedExecution. The
-- section then moved the frame itself with SetPoint and called that a drag, so
-- the harness had certified a mechanism neither half of which had run.
--
-- So the snippets run here. Not as ordinary Lua, which is what the state driver
-- stub in 05-quests.lua used to do and is a different lie: ordinary Lua reaches
-- _G, reaches every method on the frame, and reaches the PascalCase no-op in
-- 01-widgets.lua that answers any call at all. A snippet that ran under that
-- would swallow the StartMoving bug in silence.
--
-- What runs instead is the body compiled with loadstring and set to an
-- environment carrying two things and nothing else: the small library the
-- client puts in a managed environment, and frame handles. A handle is not the
-- frame. It answers the methods the restricted environment carries, it refuses
-- everything else by name, and the frames it hands back are handles in their
-- turn, so a snippet cannot climb out through GetParent into the real widget.
--
-- **What this proves and what it does not.** It proves what the snippet does:
-- which attributes it reads, which frames it walks, and what it leaves behind.
-- It proves a snippet reaching for a call the restricted environment does not
-- have, which is the bug above and the reason the file exists. It does not
-- prove the client's own parser accepts the body, and it cannot: the taint
-- rules and the bytecode filter are the client's, and nothing outside the game
-- carries them. Every caller in the addon still probes for the template and
-- falls back, and CanPage and CanRelease still report which path came up.
--
-- The environment is kept per handler frame and lives as long as the frame,
-- which is the client's own arrangement and is load bearing: Charge/Icon.lua
-- calls Execute once to put `button` in scope and then reads that name from a
-- state snippet that runs minutes later.

-- actually reach for plus the two string calls anybody writing a seventh would
-- reach for first. A name that is missing errors at the point of the call with
-- the name in it, which is the same answer the client gives and is the failure
-- this whole file exists to make reachable.
--
-- No _G, no loadstring, no pcall, no CreateFrame, and no debug. Those are the
-- doors the restricted environment closes, and a sandbox that left one open
-- would let a snippet do from here what it cannot do in the game.
