-- The hand on the mouse
--
-- Every press in this harness used to be delivered by naming a script. A
-- section reached into a frame's own table, called OnClick or OnDragStart, and
-- read back what happened. That answers "does this handler do the right thing"
-- and nothing else, and the questions it cannot ask are the ones that shipped
-- bugs: is the frame on screen, does it take the mouse at all, is anything
-- lying over it, and would the client have handed it this button.
--
-- The character sheet's grip is the case worth writing down. It sat at a frame
-- level under the page it is a strip across the top of, so nothing the player
-- could aim at ever reached it and the window could not be dragged. The section
-- asserted the ordering it found, which was the broken one, and then called the
-- grip's OnDragStart by name. Both halves passed. A stub with no hit test
-- cannot tell "under the page" from "unreachable", because they are the same
-- picture to it.
--
-- So a press goes to a point on the screen and this file works out who gets it,
-- the way the client does: shown, taking the mouse, the point inside its own
-- rectangle, and the topmost of whatever is left. Topmost is strata first, then
-- frame level inside the strata, then the later frame of two at the same level,
-- which puts a child over the parent it was made from.
--
-- **The coordinate space is the one 02-text.lua measures in**, which is
-- UIParent's own corner at the origin with x to the right and y upward, in
-- physical units rather than interface ones, so a frame at a scale of its own
-- can be compared with a frame at another. H.mouse.Point turns a frame into a
-- point in it, and a section aiming at a widget should go through that rather
-- than write two numbers down.
--
-- **What is not modelled.** A frame with no parent chain up to UIParent is not
-- reachable here, which covers the handful of loose regions the stubs stand up
-- outside the tree. There is no drag threshold: a grab followed by a move is a
-- drag, where the client wants a few pixels of travel first. And one move of
-- the pointer runs one frame of the client for the frame under it and its
-- parents rather than for everything on screen, because a secure drag hangs its
-- follow on the frame it moves and running every ticker in the addon would be a
-- scene change rather than a mouse move.
