--
-- Nothing here is a client. It is enough of one to load every file in TOC
-- order and answer what ../sections asks. What it does not prove is that the

-- The bars' steady state, in KB per fifty ticks with two bars up, covering the
-- plate path and the list path both.
--
-- A ratchet, not a ceiling. It was 51.76 before the list collector stopped
-- allocating and 4.10 after, so the gate went in at 5.0. Then it measured 0.17
-- and the gate came to 0.5, then 0.09 and the gate came to 0.25. It measures
-- 0.00 now and the gate is 0.05.
--
-- What took it to zero is named and is not a scene change this time. The tick
-- was rebuilding the party or raid on every pass to get the unit list its
-- threat comparison walks, which is a table write and a token concat per
-- member, five times a second, for an answer that changes when somebody joins.
-- ns.Unit.Roster already held that list and rebuilds it on GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE,
-- so the walk is gone and what is left on the tick allocates nothing at all.
--
-- The gate is 0.05 rather than 0.00 because a gate of zero is a claim the
-- measurement can never move, and this one is a sampled figure.

-- The skin's tick, in KB per fifty ticks across all three unit frames. Same
-- kind of ratchet. It was 18.75 while the level tag was built and then compared
-- on every tick, which is a tostring and a concat per frame to say a number
-- that changes when the unit does, and 0.00 once the tags were interned. Set at
-- the smallest figure that is not a claim the measurement can never move.

-- The meters' tick, in KB per fifty ticks, with a party of three, both panes up
-- and the clock running. Same kind of ratchet as the two above, measured on a
-- harder scene.
--
-- Those two are quoted with nothing moving, and a meter with nothing moving
-- allocates nothing at all: every write in Meter/Window.lua is guarded on a
-- number rather than on the string it would make, so a frozen meter measures
-- 0.00 here. A gate on that figure would be measuring the guards.
--
-- So the clock moves inside the loop. The seconds tick over, the rates fall
-- between them, and the strings that draw both have to be built. That is a
-- meter's real steady state and it cannot be zero. It measures 0.16 and the
-- gate is 0.20.
--
-- Which is not an argument that the guards are wasted. In a fight they save
-- very little, because the numbers move every tick and the string gets built
-- either way. What they buy is the other case entirely: a meter sitting on
-- screen between pulls, which is most of a session, costs nothing at all.

-- The cloned action bars' tick, in KB per fifty ticks across every square on
-- every bar the stub client has on, which is four bars of twelve.
--
-- Same kind of ratchet as the three above and quoted on the same terms. Nothing
-- in Bars.Update builds anything: the slot comes back off the button's own
-- action attribute, Slot.State returns loose values rather than a table, and
-- Ability.Draw compares before every write. Forty-eight squares with nothing
-- moving therefore measure 0.00, and the gate is the smallest figure that is
-- not a claim a sampled number can never move.
--
-- What would move it is the shape this addon has caught twice already: a table
-- built per square to carry the six values Ability.Draw takes as six
-- arguments. At forty-eight squares and ten ticks a second that is four hundred
-- and eighty throwaway tables a second, which is the number this gate exists to
-- refuse.

-- The swing timer's tick, in KB per fifty ticks with both hands running and the
-- Slam band drawn. This is the only thing in the addon that draws on every
-- frame, so it is the tick where an allocation costs the most.
--
-- Nothing on that path builds anything. The fill is one multiply and one
-- SetValue, the band is placed only when one of its two pixel edges moves, and
-- ns.Slam.Window hands back three numbers rather than a table.
--
-- It measured 0.03 with the fill rounded to a pixel and written only when that
-- pixel changed, and it measures 0.03 with the fill written unguarded on every
-- frame. That is the measurement the unguarded write was asked for: dropping
-- the guard bought smooth motion and cost nothing the collector can see. The
-- gate stays at 0.05. What is left of the 0.03 is the flip: the gauge repaints
-- its fill, its spent track and its four edges twice a swing, on the two ticks
-- the window opens and closes on.

-- The enemy cast fills, in KB per two hundred frames with two mobs each casting
-- a three second spell over and over. The second thing in the addon to draw on
-- every frame, and the one with the most of them on screen at once: fifteen
-- plates in a raid is fifteen fills and fifteen counting numbers.
--
-- Quoted with the mobs casting rather than idle, for the reason the meters are
-- quoted with the clock moving. Idle, the sweep is a walk and one IsShown per
-- bar and measures nothing, and a gate on that figure would be measuring the
-- early return.
--
-- It measures 0.00. The fill is a subtract, a divide and a SetValue, and the
-- number under it is drawn from a table of strings built once per tenth ever
-- shown, so a mob casting the same spell twice draws the second one out of the
-- first one's leavings. Written as a plain format call it measured 0.93, which
-- is a hundred and fifty throwaway strings a second at raid size.

-- The row of what you have out, in KB per fifty ticks with every slot filled
-- and the clock running, which is the state where the seconds over each square
-- have to be rebuilt as they fall.
--
-- Quoted with the clock moving for the reason the meters are. A row of four
-- frozen squares allocates nothing at all, because UI/Aura.lua guards the timer
-- on the reading rather than on the seconds, and a gate on that figure would be
-- measuring the guard rather than the tick.
--
-- It measures 0.27 and the gate is 0.30. What is in that figure is one string
-- per square per second and nothing else: four squares counting down in whole
-- seconds is four SetTexts a second and four strings behind them, and above a
-- minute it is four strings a minute instead. Everything else on the tick is
-- guarded. Standing.State hands back five loose values rather than a table, and
-- a table per square per tick is the shape this addon has caught twice already
-- and the one this gate exists to refuse.

	"02-place",
	"03-player",
	"04-hands",
	"05-quests",
	"06-log",
	"07-chat",
	-- Last of the seven that were here, because it layers over what 03-player
	-- and 06-log installed: a token the group knows about is answered from its
	-- own record and everything else falls through to the constants those two
	-- shipped. It also wraps CreateFrame, which every file above it defines or
	-- uses, so it has to be the last word on that as well.
	"09-group",
	-- After 09-group, because it makes a frame and 09-group is the last word on
	-- CreateFrame. It also wraps the UseContainerItem that 04-hands installed:
	-- the same call sells at a merchant and attaches at a mailbox, and which one
	-- it does is the flag the send pane sets, so both behaviours have to be
	-- reachable from one function the way they are in the game.
	"10-mail",
	-- Last, because it wraps the CreateFrame 09-group already wrapped and has to
	-- be the outermost of the two: a frame asked for with GameTooltipTemplate
	-- has to reach this whatever else is layered underneath.
	"11-tooltip",
	-- After 05-quests and after 09-group, and both matter. It replaces the two
	-- log calls 05-quests installed with a log that has zone headers in it,
	-- which is the shape the client really answers and the shape Quests/Log.lua
	-- exists to fold; the quest that file's clutter fixtures need you to be on
	-- is still in it. And it makes a frame, so it has to come after the last
	-- word on CreateFrame.
	--
	-- Below 11-tooltip rather than above it, which does not break that file's
	-- claim to be last: what it is last at is wrapping CreateFrame, and this
	-- file wraps nothing. It asks for one frame through the region helper and
	-- installs plain functions on _G beside it.
	"12-questlog",
	-- Last, and it reads what 03-player and 04-hands left: the item table it
	-- adds four pieces of gear to, and the worn table 04-hands answers every
	-- slot that is not a hand out of. One GetInventoryItemLink in this client
	-- rather than two wrapping each other.
	"13-character",
	-- Last, and it needs nothing but the Region table 01-widgets exported and
	-- the counted calls the files above installed: it defines the press that
	-- reaches all of them, and the client's own half of one.
	"14-secure",
	-- Last, and it layers over what 12-questlog.lua installed rather than
	-- replacing it: the same C_Map answers the quest log's two zones and the
	-- world map's tree, because both windows draw through UI/Chart.lua and a
	-- second C_Map would leave one of them reading the wrong one. It also fills
	-- in the two registers 05-quests.lua left empty on Questie's map module,
	-- and makes one frame, so it wants the last word on CreateFrame above it.
	"15-worldmap",
	-- Last, and it layers over 15-worldmap.lua the way that file layers over
	-- 12-questlog.lua: the same C_Map answers the quest log's zones, the world
	-- map's tree and the dungeon log's dungeons. It also wraps the two item
	-- lookups 04-hands.lua installed so they answer an id as well as a link,
	-- which is the one part of the addon that starts from an id.
	"16-dungeons",
	-- Last, and it reads what 03-player.lua and 04-hands.lua left: the item
	-- table it adds a vendor's rack to, the bags it counts a token out of, and
	-- the merchant frame 04-hands.lua made so the trash sweep would have
	-- something to check. It gives that frame a size, because the addon parks it
	-- off the side of the screen and a frame with no width has no edges to read.
	"17-merchant",
	-- Last, and it reads what 06-log.lua left: the three trees the window
	-- heads its boards with, so a spec run that gives one tree every point is
	-- the same run the talent window paints. It takes GetNumTalents over from
	-- 04-hands.lua and leaves that file's GetTalentInfo for the Slam window.
	"18-talents",
	-- Last, and it takes the four book calls over from 03-player.lua: that
	-- file answers three indices and no tabs, which is all the drag readers
	-- asked, and the spell book window walks the tabs. The first three
	-- indices stay what 03-player.lua said, with the same ids, so the three
	-- sections that drag off them by index see no change. It also makes one
	-- frame, so it wants the last word on CreateFrame above it.
	"19-spellbook",
	-- Last, and it reads what 03-player.lua left: the item table it adds six
	-- reagents to, so a link off a recipe reads back as an id the same way a
	-- link out of a bag does, and the link builder that makes one. It installs
	-- nothing any file above it touches and makes no frame.
	"20-tradeskill",
	-- Last of the client's own parts, and it wants every one of them: it runs
	-- the addon's secure snippets, and a snippet reaches frames, attributes,
	-- frame references and the override binding layer, which the files above
	-- install between them. 02-text.lua and 14-secure.lua call into it through
	-- H rather than by name for that reason.
	"21-restricted",
	-- Last, and it reads the whole tree rather than any one file: a press goes
	-- to a point on the screen and it works out which frame the client would
	-- hand it to. It wants 01-widgets.lua's delivery gate and 02-text.lua's
	-- geometry, and everything under it has to have finished putting Blizzard's
	-- own frames on the screen before a hit test means anything.
	"22-mouse",
	-- Last, and it reads what 04-hands.lua and 13-character.lua left: the item
	-- table it adds four gems to, the link builder that makes one, and the
	-- helmet with two holes in it that this file gives the socketing session its
	-- colours for. It makes one frame, Blizzard's own socketing window, which
	-- the addon parks off the side of the screen.
	"23-sockets",
	-- Last, and it wants nothing above it: no frame, no geometry and no name
	-- any other file left. It takes IsAddOnLoaded over from 07-chat.lua, so it
	-- has to be under it and is under everything else for no other reason.
