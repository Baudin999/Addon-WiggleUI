-- The client's own tooltip, as much of it as UI/Scan.lua reads
--
-- The stats on an item, the rank and the cost on an action slot, the sentence
-- under a debuff: all of it is computed inside the game and no API hands it
-- over. The addon reads it the only supported way, by pointing a hidden
-- GameTooltip at the thing and reading the font strings back, and until this
-- file existed the stub answered none of that. CreateFrame ignored the
-- template, the probe in UI/Scan.lua failed, and every tooltip in the addon
-- that draws the client's own words fell through to its title. The whole path
-- was untested and looked tested.
--
-- So a frame asked for with GameTooltipTemplate comes back doing the five
-- things the scanner leans on: it takes an owner, it clears, it takes a setter,
-- it counts its lines, and its lines are reachable as globals built from its
-- own name.
--
-- **What it says is a section's to decide.** H.tooltips is one table per kind,
-- keyed by whatever the setter is passed, and a section seeds the entry it is
-- about to hover. There is no default answer on purpose: a stub that invented a
-- line for every question would make "the client said nothing" unreachable, and
-- that is the state half the fallbacks in the addon exist for.
--
-- **And Blizzard's own tooltip, which is the other half.** A creature in the
-- world has no frame for the addon to answer for, so the client fills and shows
-- GameTooltip itself and the addon takes it back down. That means the stub has
-- to be able to put the client's box up the way the client does: showing it
-- with a unit in it, and showing it with anything else, because the whole of
-- the suppression is that it acts on the first and leaves the second alone.
--
-- What this cannot prove is that the game agrees. The line count, the order and
-- the colours are modelled from the contract, and a model that is wrong is a
-- test that passes and a client that does not.
