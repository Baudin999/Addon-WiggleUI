-- in 21-restricted.lua rather than as ordinary Lua. It used to be ordinary Lua
-- and that was its own lie: a body running under _G reaches every method on the
-- frame, including the PascalCase no-op that answers any call at all, so a
-- snippet calling something the restricted environment does not carry passed
-- here and failed in the game. What the run proves is what the snippet does.
-- What it cannot prove is that the client's own parser accepts the body, which
-- is why DrivePages probes for the template and CanPage reports which path came
-- up.
