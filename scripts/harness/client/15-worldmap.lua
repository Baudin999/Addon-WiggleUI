-- The world map: the client's map tree, Questie's icon frames, and the
-- window this addon puts in the attic.
--
-- Three fixtures, and each one exists because the part reads something no file
-- above this one installs.
--
-- **The tree.** C_Map answers a map's children, and Map/Zones.lua walks that
-- to build the column of zones. The shape here is the shape the client really
-- has: a cosmic map over a world over two continents over their zones, with
-- every node carrying the parent that Map/Zones.lua climbs to find the top.
-- The zones under a continent are handed over out of alphabetical order on
-- purpose, because sorting them is a claim that file makes.
--
-- The ids are the ones these two clients really use, read off Questie's own
-- generated areaIdToUiMapId, and that matters more here than anywhere else in
-- the stub: Map/Zones.lua carries a table of level ranges keyed on them, so a
-- fixture with invented ids would test the walk and never once test the table.
-- One zone is deliberately an id nothing has a row for, which is the branch
-- where the footer has to say so rather than guess.
--
-- **Questie's icon frames.** Questie draws a marker by making a frame and
-- handing it to HereBeDragons, and Map/Pins.lua reads the frames rather than
-- the picture. So the fixture is frames: one for a world marker, one for its
-- minimap twin, one Questie has fake-hidden, one in another zone, and one out
-- of the second register, which is where the flight masters and the trainers
-- go. Only two of the five belong on the zone being drawn, which is what makes
-- this worth a fixture rather than a list of points.
--
-- **Blizzard's window and the M key.** Both plain and both probed by the addon
-- before they are touched, so the cage and the key swap have something to act
-- on.
