-- Everything the addon's own character window reads: what is in the eighteen
-- slots that are not a hand, the stats and ratings the sheet adds up, the skill
-- lines, the faction lines, and the two calls that put a piece on or take it
-- off.
--
-- Modelled rather than stubbed flat, and one number in it decides most of the
-- section. Weapon skill starts ten points short of the cap for this
-- character's level, because a fixture at the cap would leave the whole
-- shortfall branch of the miss maths unreachable and would let a formula that
-- ignored weapon skill pass either way. The published miss figures are the
-- check: at the cap a character misses 5.5%, 6% and 9% at one, two and three
-- levels up, and the section asserts all three by closing the ten points and
-- opening them again.
--
-- The ratings are the second decision. This is the 2.5.6 client, so combat
-- ratings exist and both indices answer. Section 53 takes them away again to
-- stand the addon on the older client for a moment, which is the branch where
-- the page has to say it cannot subtract rather than subtracting zero.

-- the sheet does not load one until somebody opens it, and a load nobody asked
-- for leaves nothing else behind to assert on.
--
-- It lives here rather than beside the other Region methods because the sheet
-- is the only thing in the addon that draws a player model, and 02-text.lua is
-- at its own ceiling.
--
-- Counted twice: on the region, for the sheet's own section, and once for the

-- would have said, and a figure that was never walked nearer and never handed

-- is the number that actually reached the model, so this is where the number
-- has to stop.
--
-- The fourth is SetRotation and it is already in 02-text.lua, because the client

-- first. Read back with GetRotation, the same way the arrow's is.
