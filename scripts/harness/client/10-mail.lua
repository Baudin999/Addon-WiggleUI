-- The mailbox
--
-- Enough of one to stand the mail window up and drive a send through it. The
-- two halves are modelled rather than stubbed away, because both of them are
-- where the part can be wrong in a way no amount of reading it would show.
--
-- The outbox is a form with twelve slots that UseContainerItem fills, which is
-- how the client really attaches an item and is what Baganator does on this
-- client. A stub that took an attachment straight off a list would make the
-- split into several mails pass without the form ever having been full.
--
-- The send is asynchronous, and that is the point of it. SendMail here records
-- the mail and answers nothing; MAIL_SEND_SUCCESS arrives when a section says
-- so. A stub that fired it from inside SendMail would run the addon's own
-- handler with Post still on the stack, which is a shape the game never
-- produces and would hide the one thing the state machine is for.
--
-- The inbox renumbers when a message is taken, because that is the failure the
-- sweep is written against: taking message three moves four to three, and a
-- sweep walking upwards would skip every other one.
