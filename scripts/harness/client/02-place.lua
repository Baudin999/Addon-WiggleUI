-- Where a frame is
--
-- Anchors, the size a frame gets from them, the corner each one resolves to,
-- which frame is over which, and the drag the client runs on your behalf. One
-- file because they are one question asked five ways: a hit test needs a
-- rectangle, a rectangle needs a size, a size can come from a pair of opposing
-- anchors, an anchor is measured against another frame's corner, and which of
-- two frames at that point takes the press is strata and level.
--
-- Split out of 02-text.lua rather than left in it. That file is the Region stub
-- and is allow-listed for being one class, which held while the geometry in it
-- was four functions answering a constant. It is not four functions any more:
-- 22-mouse.lua asks where things really are, and everything that used to answer
-- "near enough" had to start answering.
--
-- **The origin is UIParent's top left corner**, with x to the right and y
-- downward and negative. That is not the client's origin, which is the bottom
-- left of the screen, and it does not matter: every reader here takes a
-- difference between two of these numbers and a difference is the same in both.
-- The one place the two meet is the cursor, and 22-mouse.lua says how.

-- The size a frame was given, or the size its two anchors give it.

-- put it under the rail and made it unpressable. Every assertion about that row
-- passed, because nothing but a pointer cares where a button really is.
--
-- Only where the size was never written. SetWidth and SetSize win outright, and
-- a frame with one anchor or none still answers zero, which is what the client
-- answers as well.
--
-- The guard is for a cycle rather than for depth. Two frames anchored to each
-- other have no size the client could work out either, and answering zero once
-- is better than running out of stack.
