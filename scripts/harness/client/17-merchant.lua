-- The vendor.
--
-- Five things on a rack, chosen so that every branch a row can take is on the
-- screen at once: an ordinary price, a stack the vendor sells two hundred at a
-- time, a limited supply, something this class cannot use, and one priced in
-- tokens rather than in money. Nothing here is convenient; each row is a shape
-- the real merchant API answers and the addon has to draw differently.
--
-- What this does not model is the item arriving in your bags. A purchase moves
-- the purse, counts down a limited supply and fires the update the client fires,
-- which is every part of the sale the merchant window reads. Where the thing
-- lands is the container API's business and 04-hands.lua already owns it, and
-- putting a sixth item in a bag here would move the slot counts three other
-- sections are written against.
