-- A press on a button
--
-- The half of a click that the addon writes is its handlers. The other half
-- belongs to the client, and this file is here because that half decides
-- whether a button does anything at all.
--
-- **The edge is the point.** A button registered for AnyDown does nothing on an
-- up press, so the caller says which edge: a key binding press and a mouse
-- release are not the same event and the client does not guess either.
--
-- **And a secure button does not act on the edge it registered for.** It reads
-- its own `useOnKeyDown` attribute, falls back to the player's
-- ActionButtonUseKeyDown setting where it does not answer, and on the other
-- edge does nothing whatever its attributes say. That is how a gear square
-- registered for the release, holding a correct macro, drew and hovered and
-- applied no sharpening stone, and it is the second time this addon has shipped
-- that bug. A stub that ran the handlers and called that a click cannot tell
-- the two apart, so this one runs the client's half in the middle.
