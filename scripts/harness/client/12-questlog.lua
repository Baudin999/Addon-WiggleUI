-- The quest log
--
-- Enough of one to stand the quest window up and drive every column of it. Two
-- things here are modelled rather than stubbed away, and both are places the
-- part can be wrong in a way no amount of reading it would show.
--
-- **The cursor is real.** SelectQuestLogEntry moves a selection this file
-- keeps, and every text and reward call reads whatever it is pointing at. A
-- stub that answered for the index it was handed would make Quests/Client.lua's
-- borrow-and-restore look correct while it was doing nothing at all, and the
-- symptom in the game is another addon's quest log jumping to whichever quest
-- this window last drew.
--
-- **Headers are rows.** The client's log is a flat run where a zone is a row
-- like any other, which is the whole reason Quests/Log.lua exists. A stub that
-- handed over a list of quests with a zone field on each would test a model
-- that does not have to do anything.
--
-- The log deliberately holds quest 102, and only 102, of the four quests
-- scripts/harness/client/05-quests.lua files under Questie. The clutter scan
-- reads this same pair of calls to decide which items are spent, so the two
-- files have to agree about what you are on.

-- are modelled here rather than stubbed flat: a fixture that handed over map
-- ids directly would test a window that cannot exist.
--
-- Every branch the map can take is one row of this data.
--
--   two zones      the quest has spawns in Elwynn and in Westfall, so the strip
--                  of zones under the map has something to choose between
--   a third zone   area 606, which Questie has a row for and the client has no
--                  map id for. It must not reach the strip: a zone nothing can
--                  draw is not a choice.
--   two spawns
--     on one step  30,40 and 30.4,40.4 are the same camp. Two dots in five
--                  pixels is one dot drawn twice, and the pool grows to
--                  whatever the worst quest in the database asks for.
--   a -1 spawn     Questie saying the thing is inside an instance, whose
--                  entrance is a row it does not hand over here. Drawn, it
--                  lands in the top left corner of the zone.
--   a finished
--     objective    its spawns are the half of the answer that would make the
--                  other half hard to see
--   the finisher   a spawn that comes from the database rather than from the
--                  quest object, off a different call
--   the icon       which of Questie's marks it drew the thing with. `Icon` is
--                  the field a real spawn list entry carries and `Type` is not:
--                  Questie builds these in objectiveSpawnListCallTable as an
--                  id, a name, the spawns, the waypoints and one of its own
--                  ICON_TYPE numbers, and it has never put the word "monster"
--                  on one. The fixture said Type for a long time, which
