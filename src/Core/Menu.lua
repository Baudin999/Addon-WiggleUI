local ADDON, ns = ...

-- Where the addon sits in the client's own menu.
--
-- Everything in here answers one complaint: a slash command is a thing you have
-- to be told about. Escape is a thing everyone already presses. So the addon
-- puts one button in that menu, it says WarriorKit, and it opens the same panel
-- /wk opens. No setting guards it, because a checkbox that hides the way into
-- the settings is a checkbox nobody can find their way back to.
--
-- The button hangs off the bottom of the frame with a margin, and the frame
-- grows by exactly what that costs. That is the whole placement, and it is the
-- second attempt.
--
-- The first one read the menu's anchor chain, worked out which button was at
-- the foot of it, took that button's anchor and re-anchored the foot to ours.
-- It is a nicer picture and it does not survive contact. Blizzard rewrote this
-- frame on the modern clients and the rewrite lays every button out against the
-- frame itself, so there is no chain to read; the walk that coped with that
-- included our own button among the candidates, so once the client relaid its
-- column our button could come back as the foot and be anchored to itself. In
-- game that read as a button you saw on every other press of Escape.
--
-- None of that is worth a nicer picture. The frame's own bottom edge is a thing
-- every version of this menu has, it needs no walk, it cannot come back as our
-- own button, and Blizzard's buttons are never touched at all. Theirs are
-- placed by code we cannot see and re-placed whenever it likes, and a button of
-- ours that moved one of them would be undone on the next show and would take
-- one of Blizzard's with it.
--
-- The one thing still read off the menu is a button to copy a size from, and
-- that is cosmetic: a size we cannot measure leaves the kit's own, which is a
-- readable button in the addon's own proportions and only fails to line up with
-- the column above it.
--
-- The paint is Core/MenuSkin.lua and it is a second subject rather than a
-- second half of this one. That file answers the complaint this one made
-- worse: our button stopped wearing Blizzard's art, which is right, and put a
-- flat grey rectangle under nine red ones, which read as stapled on. It draws
-- the whole menu in the kit's look instead, on a switch, and it moves nothing
-- either. This file still owns the button, the placement and the height; that
-- one owns every pixel of paint on the frame around it, and neither goes
-- looking through the other.

-- The air under our button, and the same again above it. A number chosen rather
-- than measured, which is the point: the old file measured the gap between two

-- worth what reading it cost. Ours is the last thing in the menu and it is
-- allowed to look like it.

-- Above whatever the menu draws inside itself. Ours is a child of the menu and

-- these frames stacks inside itself.
local LIFT = 10

local button, refusal

-- What the menu was tall before we grew it, and what we last set it to. The
-- pair is how re-attaching stays idempotent across a client that recomputes the
-- menu's height on every show and one that does not: if the height still reads
-- back as what we wrote, nothing has recomputed and the base stands.
local base, grown

-- What the last attach found to copy a size from. Carried for `/wk status`,
-- because a button at the kit's own size in a menu whose buttons are a
-- different size is a thing you can see and would want explained.
local copied

-- One anchor off a frame the addon does not own.
--
-- ns.Measure is the house call for this and takes no arguments and returns one
-- value, and an anchor is an index in and five values out. Same contract
-- though: a restricted frame raises rather than answering, and the answer to
-- that is nil, not a screenful of errors.

-- with no bottom to it, and the prize here is a width.
