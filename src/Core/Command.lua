-- A word table, and the runner that walks it.
--
-- Thirty-odd branches in this addon were the same four steps: parse the value,
-- write `ns.db.<key>`, call the module's Apply, print a sentence. Written by
-- hand they read as a chain of ifs one word long each, and two of them sat on
-- the shape allow-list as "a slash dispatcher, one branch per word". Written as
-- a table they are data: the four steps live here once, and what a word decides
-- for itself is the closure it carries rather than another branch in a hundred
-- line function.
--
-- An entry is `{ "<word>", <kind>, key = "<db key>", say = function(new) end }`
-- and the kind is one of four:
--
--   number = { low, high }        a whole number in range, refused outside it
--   step   = { low, high, step }  the same on a coarser ruler
--   toggle = true                 on unless the value is "off"
--   choice = { "one", "two" }     one of a named set, refused with the set
--
-- A range the owning file already computes is written as a function returning
-- those same numbers, so no range is typed here that is written down there.
--
-- Anything none of the four describes carries `run` instead and stays a
-- function taking the value. That is the escape hatch and it is meant to be
-- used: a word that adds a spell to a list is not a setting, and dressing it as
-- one buys nothing.
--
-- `say` receives what was written and returns the sentence, or up to three of
-- them. Returning nothing says nothing.
--
-- The table itself carries `name`, which the range message reads with; `apply`,
-- which every entry that does not name its own uses, and which `apply = false`
-- on an entry says is not wanted for that word; `show`, what the bare word
-- prints; `otherwise`, the on|off toggle every one of these dispatchers ends
-- in; and `finally`, for the one that redraws after each word whichever it was.
--
-- `otherwise` is an entry when the unknown word is simply the on|off value, and
-- a function taking the word and the rest of the line when the part has more
-- lists to look the word up in first.
