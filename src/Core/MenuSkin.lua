-- The client's own menu, drawn in the addon's look.
--
-- Core/Menu.lua puts one button at the foot of the game menu, and that button
-- is the kit's: a flat grey rectangle, one physical pixel of edge, the addon's
-- own sans. Blizzard's nine above it are red glass on a parchment frame with
-- gold corners. Stack the two and ours reads as something that got stapled on,
-- which is exactly what the first screenshot of it showed.
--
-- Two ways out of that and only one of them is honest. Paint our button like
-- theirs, and the way into a window drawn in greys is a gold button, and the
-- addon has an opinion about 2007 art here that it holds nowhere else in the
-- interface. Or paint the menu. This file is the second.
--
-- It is the same job Artwork/Artwork.lua does to the action bars, on the same
-- two calls, and it keeps that file's rule: textures go, frames stay. Nothing
-- here hides a frame, because a frame in this menu is either a button that has
-- to keep working or a box the buttons hang off, and hiding either takes the
-- column with it. What goes is every texture and the heading, and what arrives
-- is the kit's own panel underneath and the kit's own paint on each button.
--
-- Nothing moves. Not one of Blizzard's buttons is anchored, resized or
-- relevelled, and the reason is the long one in Core/Menu.lua: this column is
-- laid out on every show, on the newer flavours by a layout pass that runs
-- after our hook, so a placement of ours is a placement that comes undone in
-- front of you. Paint survives that, and it survives it without a second
-- mechanism. A texture we hid stays hidden because ns.Strip leaves Hide where
-- Show used to be, and a font string we dressed stays dressed because the
-- client does not rewrite the font on a button it did not just create.
--
-- Nothing here calls anything of Blizzard's either. Every button in the menu
-- keeps its own OnClick, so Logout is still Blizzard's Logout, run from
-- Blizzard's code off Blizzard's button, and this addon is a coat of paint on
-- the path rather than a step in it. That is deliberate and it is the whole
-- reason this is a skin and not a replacement menu: a menu of our own would
-- have to make those calls itself, and the two that matter are the two an
-- addon is not allowed to make.
--
-- And it all goes back in one call, because the switch on the panel is a
-- switch and not a reload. Blizzard's regions come back through ns.Unstrip,
-- every string we dressed goes back into the font it was wearing when we found
-- it, and our own paint is hidden rather than destroyed: a texture cannot be
-- un-created, and the next switch on wants it anyway.

-- How far down the menu a button is looked for. One level, for the reason
-- Core/Menu.lua gives for its own walk: the whole tree of somebody else's
-- frame is a walk with no bottom, and every flavour of this menu either hangs
-- the column off the frame or hangs it off one box inside it.
