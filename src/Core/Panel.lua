-- The options window. It builds one page of its own, On and off, and gets the
-- rest by walking the registry, handing each feature the widget kit from
-- UI/Widgets.lua and letting it draw its own rows.
--
-- None of that happens until somebody opens it.
--
-- It happened at PLAYER_LOGIN until now, and it is about a thousand frames,
-- eighteen hundred textures and one run of every getter behind every row on
-- sixty five pages, for a window most sessions never open. The window is made
-- by the first Show, the first Open or the first Toggle, and a session that
-- never asks for it pays nothing at all. Anything that wants the window rather
-- than a page of it asks Options.Window, which answers nil until then.
--
-- A row is put back in step when the page it is on comes up, and at no other
-- time. UI/Widgets.lua skips a widget that is not on the screen, so the getters
-- behind the other sixty four pages, which walk your bags, your spellbook, your
-- factions and Questie's lists, no longer run because something moved on the
-- page you are looking at.
--
-- One piece of navigation, and it is not the registry.
--
-- The rail down the left is nine groups, declared below and owned by no
-- feature. A group is a thing you can see on the screen or a job you came to
-- do. It folds: the group you are in stands open with its sections listed
-- under it, and every `ui.Section(title, group)` a feature writes is one of
-- those lines.
--
-- The fold replaced a strip of tabs across the top of the page, and the reason
-- is that the strip could only ever show one group's sections. Forty five of
-- them behind eight rail entries meant the window showed an eighth of itself at
-- a time, and Fighting's eleven wrapped onto three lines of stubs that took a
-- fifth of the page's height. A column says the same thing in a column, and it
-- says it about the group you are in while the others stay one line each.
--
-- That is the whole of the change from one rail entry per part. A part is a
-- folder of code, and eighteen folder names down the left asked a new player to
-- guess that the camera distance was under Comfort and that the window's own
-- size was under Settings. It also forced a part's sections to live together
-- whether or not they belonged together: Chat opens a window and Comfort sells
-- your greys, and each of those files also has a section that is about the
-- screen. A section says where it goes, so a file can spread over two groups
-- without a line of code moving between files.
--
-- A part's `order` no longer decides where it sits in the rail, because the
-- rail is not made of parts. It decides where a part's sections sit inside
-- whichever group they named, and it is a whole unique number so that two parts
-- cannot land in the same place and leave the answer to table.sort.
--
-- One switch per part is drawn here rather than by the part. Eleven features
-- each wrote their own check box for "does this draw anything", no two of them
-- worded the same way, and none of them visible without opening the page it was
-- on. Declared under `switch` in the registry, it is drawn at the top of the
-- page the part names for it, it fills On and off, and the rail marks any
-- group holding a part that is on.
--
-- Everything else this file used to own lives a layer down. UI/Theme.lua has
-- the palette and the measurements, UI/Stack.lua lays a column out and lets each
-- row say how tall it is, UI/Scroll.lua clips and scrolls, UI/Widgets.lua is the
-- kit, and UI/Window.lua is the chrome. What is left here is which groups exist,
-- where each section goes and what the footer does.

-- holding every window the addon draws, because a bag window is a chore in the
-- sense that sorting is. Nobody looking for the bag window thinks that. They
-- think "windows", so that is the group, and the frames are under Frames, the
-- bars under Action bars, and the switches under a name that says switches.
