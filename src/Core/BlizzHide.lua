--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The client's own frames, one switch each
--
-- Everything in here answers one question: this addon draws X, so should the
-- client's X still be on the screen? Every answer is a switch with the same
-- shape and the same default, and the whole point is that there is nothing
-- clever behind any of them. A player who can see two copies of one aura
-- should be able to find the line that says "hide Blizzard's buffs" and press
-- it, without knowing that the skin is on, that a sweep exists, or that the
-- two clients this addon runs on disagree about where a debuff lives.
--
-- **It is in Core because nine trees ask it and it is a fact about none of
-- them.** It was UnitFrames/Blizzard.lua for as long as there were nine
-- switches and unit frames owned most of them, and every window this addon
-- drew after that had to name UnitFrames to take the client's copy of itself
-- off the screen: the character sheet, the talent window, the spell book, the
-- bags, the chat, the merchant, the map and the level bar, none of which know
-- anything about a unit frame. scripts/trees.lua counted those eight edges and
-- the answer to eight edges into one file is to move the file. It sits beside
-- Core/Attic.lua, which is where a frame it takes down actually goes.
--
-- It used to be one setting that meant something different depending on what
-- the skin was doing. That was the bug: a switch whose effect you cannot
-- predict from its label is not a switch, and the honest fix was more of them
-- rather than a cleverer one.
--
-- **A switch here holds or it says so.** That is the second rewrite of this
-- file and the reason for it is worth writing down, because the first version
-- was correct and still failed twice in game.
--
-- It hid each frame once, at login, by putting the frame's own Hide where its
-- Show was, and then remembered that it had. Both halves were wrong. Replacing
-- Show does nothing about SetShown, which is resolved in C and never reads the
-- Lua field, so every FrameXML path written that way walked past it: `FCF_` uses
-- it on the chat window, which is why `/logout` put the client's chat back, and
-- the cast bar mixin uses it on the target's bar, which is why the target had
-- two cast bars with the switch on. And because the file remembered, one frame
-- that got past it stayed past it for the rest of the session.
--
-- So neither half survives. Core/Attic.lua re-parents the frame into a frame
-- that is hidden and can never be shown, which no call on the frame itself can
-- undo, and this file verifies rather than remembers: every pass re-resolves
-- every name, re-reads what is actually on the screen, and puts back anything
-- that moved. The pass runs at login, when a switch moves, when combat drops
-- and once a second forever. The raid manager used to have a hook of its own for
-- exactly this and does not need one now, which is the shape of the fix: one
-- mechanism instead of a patch per frame that somebody noticed.
--
-- Two handles take a row off the screen and this file holds one of them. A
-- frame goes down here; the buttons inside a frame nobody can hide go down one
-- name at a time in UnitFrames/Auras.lua, off the same switch and through the
-- same attic. The target's rows are the second kind, because every icon in them
-- is a child of TargetFrame and nothing else, and hiding TargetFrame is hiding
-- the target.

-- What each switch takes down, and what it takes to take it down.
--
-- `needs` is a list rather than a single key because one frame on the older
-- clients holds both of your rows. BuffFrame is your buffs and your debuffs
-- together on 2.5.6, so it may only go down when both switches are on;
-- whichever of the two is on alone is served by the sweep in
-- UnitFrames/Auras.lua, which works a button at a time and can tell them apart.
--
-- `names` is a list for the same reason and one more. DebuffFrame is the newer
-- clients splitting BuffFrame in two; it is not on 2.5.6 at all, and a name this
-- client does not carry costs one lookup against nil. That split is what put a
-- debuff back on the screen under a row already drawing it: hiding BuffFrame
-- took the buffs and left the debuffs exactly where they were. Your own cast bar
-- is two names for the same reason, CastingBarFrame on 2.5.6 and
-- PlayerCastingBarFrame on the clients this Edit Mode was backported from.
--
-- `keys` is the answer to the failure a list of names cannot cover, which is a
-- client that renamed the global. FrameXML declares these frames with a
-- parentKey, and the key outlives the global name across builds far more often
-- than the other way round, so the target's cast bar is looked for as
-- TargetFrameSpellBar and as whatever TargetFrame.spellbar is, and a client that
-- answers to either gets its bar taken down. Both resolving to the same frame
-- costs one extra table lookup and nothing else: the attic is idempotent.
--
-- One key, not several, and that is a rule rather than an accident. A key is
-- read straight off a frame this addon does not own, so a guess that lands on
-- the wrong field hides something nobody asked to hide, which is a worse failure
-- than the one the list exists to fix. `spellbar` is what FrameXML declares the
-- target's cast bar under and is the only one written from the source. Anything
-- else goes in after `/wk hide probe` has said ON SCREEN against a name and
-- somebody has read the key off the client.
--
-- The target's auras name no frame here on purpose. Every icon in those two
-- rows is a child of TargetFrame, so there is nothing between the buttons and
-- the frame you are targeting with, and the sweep in UnitFrames/Auras.lua is the
-- only handle.

-- The clock
--
-- This file named its two failure modes and then answered both with a second
-- hand: a frame the client had not built yet at the last pass, and a frame
-- somebody else re-parented. Both now have the thing that says so.
--
-- A frame built late says ADDON_LOADED. That is every load-on-demand window,
-- the talent frame and the spell book among them, and it fires before anything
-- the new frame does can put it on the screen.
--
-- A frame re-parented says SetParent, and Core/Attic.lua hooks that call on
-- every frame it cages. A cage is undone by nothing else, so the hook is not a
-- guess at the client's call sites: it is the call itself.
--
-- What is left for the clock is the client this addon has not met, where the
-- hook would not install or the frame came in before the global existed. That
-- is a backstop rather than the mechanism, so it runs at five seconds instead of
-- one.
--
-- The guarantee in the header is unchanged and is now made by three things
-- instead of one. Nothing the addon replaces stays on the screen: the cage holds
-- it, the hook puts it back on the frame it moved, and this walk is what proves
-- the first two on a client where either turns out not to work.
--
-- The cost is a dozen global lookups and a parent comparison per frame held,
-- once every five seconds, with a write only where a comparison failed. It is
-- bracketed like every other tick in the addon so the performance tab accounts
-- for it rather than leaving it as the one pass nobody can see.
--
-- The eight Blizz.Also registrants ride the same change and none of them needed
-- a hook of its own. Five of the eight put their frames in the attic and are
-- covered by its hook exactly. Bags/Blizzard.lua swaps globals rather than
-- moving a frame, so there is nothing for anybody to re-parent. Merchant
-- /Blizzard.lua and Sockets/Blizzard.lua each park a frame they may not cage,
-- and both already hook that frame's own OnShow for the one thing that moves
-- it, which is the client relaying its panels.

-- PLAYER_LOGIN starts the clock. PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED is the retry every strip
-- in the addon uses. ADDON_LOADED is the first of the clock's two jobs taken off
-- it: a load-on-demand window is built inside that event, so the pass that hides
-- it runs before the frame has been drawn once rather than up to five seconds
-- later.
--
-- Only once login has been through, which is the whole of what `started` is
-- for. ADDON_LOADED fires once per addon in the list on the way in, and the
-- addon this file belongs to is one of them. A pass run there walks frames that
-- most of this addon has not built yet, and the order it settles is not the
-- order login settles: it moved which window came first and the options window
-- stopped being the one the harness found.
