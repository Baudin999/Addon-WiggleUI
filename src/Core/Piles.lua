--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Items, in piles
--
-- A pile is the class the client already files an item under. Not a search
-- string, not a rule anybody typed. `ns.ItemKind` reads GetItemInfoInstant,
-- which comes out of the client's own item database and cannot miss the way a
-- cache lookup can, so the pile an item lands in is decided by the client and
-- is right on the first frame after a login. That is the whole reason the
-- grouping is fifteen lines rather than a feature: the client has already done
-- it and every bag addon in the world throws the answer away.
--
-- Three piles are not a class and each is worth the exception. Junk is quality
-- zero whatever class it is, because the thing every grey has in common is that
-- a vendor is where it goes. Empty is the absence of an item, and it is a pile
-- rather than a gap so a free count has something you can point at.
--
-- Session is the third and it is the odd one, because nothing in this file can
-- decide it. It is what reached your bags between pressing record and pressing
-- stop, which is a fact about an hour of your evening rather than about an
-- item, and the only part that knows it is Bags/Session.lua. What is here is
-- the pile's place in the order and its heading, and Piles.Rename below is how
-- that heading comes to say Dire Maul. Nothing fills it but the bag window: a
-- vendor's rack goes through Piles.Of, which never answers this key.
--
-- **Quality can be nil and the pile still has to be right.** GetItemInfo, which
-- is the only call that grades an item, answers nothing for an item the client
-- has not cached. That is rare for something sitting in your own bags and it is
-- not impossible, and the honest reading of nil is "do not know" rather than
-- zero. So an ungraded item stays in its class pile instead of being called
-- junk, and moves the moment GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED arrives. Every window built
-- on this file listens for that event for this reason and no other.
--
-- **It is in Core because two windows now ask.** This was Bags/Bags.lua's
-- private knowledge until the merchant window wanted the same answer about a
-- vendor's stock, and a part may not name a file outside its own tree. It is
-- the shape Core/Gear.lua and Core/Stance.lua already have: a shared file that
-- wraps a client API, owns no setting and draws nothing.
--
-- What is deliberately not here is the scan. Where the entries come from is the
-- caller's: five bags for one window and a merchant's index for the other, and
-- neither has anything to say about how the piles are ordered. This file takes
-- entries that already carry a `group` and hands back the piles that have
-- anything in them, in the order they are drawn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The one item that gets a pile of its own.
--
-- It is not a class and it does not need to be: it is the most clicked item in
-- the game, it is a Miscellaneous item, and Miscellaneous is where everything
-- goes that the client could not think of a word for. A hearthstone sitting
-- eleventh in that pile is a hearthstone you hunt for every time.
local HEARTHSTONE = 6948

-- Every pile, in the order they are drawn, and the class each one takes.
--
-- The order is the order Baganator ships on this client, because it is right
-- and because it was arrived at by people using it: what you press is at the
-- top, what you wear is under that, what you carry for a reason is under that,
-- and what you are about to be rid of is at the bottom. A pile with nothing in
-- it is not drawn at all, so the list being long costs an empty bag nothing,
-- and costs a vendor who sells one class of thing nothing either.
--
-- `name` is the fallback, in English. What is actually drawn is the client's
-- own word for the class where it will say one, resolved once at the first
-- scan, so a German client reads Handwerkswaren rather than Trade Goods.

-- The three piles that are drawn in two lanes, and why the flag is here.
--
-- Weapons and armour are the only things you carry that bind, so they are the
-- only piles where "already yours" and "still worth something to somebody else"
-- is a division you can make at all. The quest pile divides on a different
-- fact and draws the same way: what a quest in your log still wants on the
-- left, and what nothing in your log wants on the right, where it is one
-- click from gone. The flag says which fact, "bound" or "quest", because the
-- two are read off different things, a tooltip for one and Questie's item rows
-- for the other, and only the window that walks a bag can read either. It is
-- on the pile rather than in the window because it falls out of the class: an
-- item class either binds or it does not, either is a quest item or is not,
-- and that is the same fact for every window that ever draws this list.
--
-- What a lane means and how wide it is are not here. Bags/Grid.lua decides
-- both, because they are drawing, and a vendor's rack reads the same flag and
-- ignores it: nothing on a shelf is bound to anybody yet.
--
-- A lookup rather than a walk, built off the list above so the two cannot
-- drift, the same way BY_CLASS below is. It is asked once per bag slot on every
-- bag update, and a linear scan of seventeen piles a hundred and fifty times
-- for an answer that never changes is the shape this file exists to avoid.

-- the four totems a shaman carries are in among the pets and the holiday
-- trinkets. Both classes carry a subclass the client will name, Cloth or
-- Metal & Stone or Reagent, and that is the cut: one sub-pile per subclass,
-- each under the client's own word for it, and the items in one sorted by
-- their level so linen sits before wool before silk.
--
-- The subclass is the second thing Piles.Of answers and it is answered only
-- for these piles, so an entry's `sub` means "which sub-pile" and nothing
-- else. A pile whose entries all share one subclass is drawn as one pile
