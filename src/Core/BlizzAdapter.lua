--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The two ways this addon takes one of the client's windows off the screen
--
-- Eight parts drew the same file. Merchant and Sockets were a hundred and eight
-- identical lines out of a hundred and thirteen; Character and Spellbook were a
-- hundred and sixteen out of a hundred and fifty-six; Mail and Sockets were
-- eighty-four out of ninety-one. Nobody chose that. Each one was written by
-- copying the last one that worked, and what the copies drifted on was never the
-- mechanism, only the wording of a sentence and whether one branch was there.
-- Eight copies of a mechanism are eight places a fix has to land, and this addon
-- has already paid that twice: the SetShown hole Core/Attic.lua's header
-- describes had to be closed in every file that had a Show in it.
--
-- So the mechanism is here once and each part says what it is doing to which
-- frame. There are two shapes, they are not interchangeable, and picking the
-- wrong one is the failure mode this file exists to make hard.
--
-- **The park shape, for a frame that is a live session with the server.**
-- Mail, Merchant, Sockets. The client ends the session when the frame stops
-- being drawn: MailFrame_Hide, CloseMerchant and CloseSocketInfo all hang off
-- that, so both of the mechanisms the rest of the addon uses would close the
-- conversation a frame after opening it. ns.Strip begins by calling Hide, and
-- Core/Attic.lua re-parents into a hidden room, which takes visibility away by
-- the parent chain and fires the same handler. What is left is to move the
-- frame: off the right hand edge at no opacity, still shown and still parented
-- to UIParent, so every API on it goes on working and nothing of it is anywhere
-- a cursor can reach. The cost is honest and is why this is not the default: a
-- client that relays its panels puts the frame back, which is what the re-park
-- on the frame's own OnShow and the drift check on the pass are for.
--
-- **The cage shape, for a frame that is only a picture.** Character,
-- Spellbook, Talents, Quests, Map. Nothing about your gear, your spells, your
-- talents, your log or the map is a session: every call works with the frame
-- nowhere near the screen. So these take the stronger mechanism and go into
-- Core/Attic.lua, where a hidden parent beats every route the client has to put
-- a frame back, and the key that used to open the client's window is taken with
-- them, because a hidden window whose key still opens nothing is worse than
-- either window on its own.
--
-- **One field decides three things, and that is not a shortcut.** `pass` says
-- the part is registered on Core/BlizzHide.lua's once-a-second walk. A part on
-- the walk has to re-apply on every call, because a pass that remembers what it
-- did cannot see a frame the client built since; it has nothing a combat
-- lockdown can refuse, so it always answers true and there is nothing for the
-- PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED retry to pick up; and it is the only place a drift
-- correction could run. A part off the walk is called when the switch moves and
-- answers whether it moved anything. Those are one decision written three ways,
-- and they were three fields in the copies.
--
-- **What the descriptor does not carry is a frame or a window.** It carries the
-- global's name and the ns key of the part that owns the replacement, both as
-- strings, resolved when something calls rather than when this file loads. That
-- is what keeps Core out of the features: scripts/trees.lua refuses a base tree
-- naming a feature back, and it is the right refusal, because a Core file that
-- named ns.CharWindow would put every part in the addon behind the character
-- sheet.
--
-- **Four parts stayed on their own, and the reason is that neither shape fits.**
--
--   Bags/Blizzard.lua replaces nine globals and cages nothing. The client's bags
--   are not a frame you take down, they are thirteen containers it only ever
--   builds through named calls, so taking the calls is cheaper than caging the
--   result and cannot leave one half-placed.
--
--   Buttons/Blizzard.lua hides secure action buttons one at a time with
--   statehidden and Hide, and its header says why nothing here may touch them:
--   the client's bar controller calls methods on those buttons from a stack that
--   goes on to perform protected actions, and this addon's function in that
--   stack is a taint.
--
--   Chat/Blizzard.lua cages a list it computes rather than one it declares, and
--   the cage is only a third of what it does. The other two thirds are the
--   AddMessage forward and the claim that stops the forward doubling every line.
--
--   CombatText/Blizzard.lua writes four CVars and touches no frame at all.
--
-- A forced fit is worse than the duplication, and those four are the boundary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Far enough right that nothing of a four hundred pixel window shows, and
-- anchored to the screen's own edge rather than to a number, so it is off the
-- side of a 4K panel as well as a laptop. One number for all three parked
-- frames, because it is the same question about three frames of about the same
-- width.

--            whether it is open, because a parked frame with no window over
--            it is a session with nothing on the screen at all
--   pass     registered on the once-a-second walk, and re-parked on it
--   late     what Describe says before the client has ever built the frame,
--            for a window that arrives with a load-on-demand addon
--   loads    that addon's name, watched so the park lands the moment it does

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The descriptor:
--
--   frames    every global the client's window is made of, probed one at a
--             time, because these differ between the two clients this addon
--             ships for and a name that is missing has to cost that frame
--             rather than the feature
--   feature   the db key for this addon's own part being on
--   switch    the db key for the switch that hides the client's
--   global    the client's own toggle, taken so the key opens ours. Absent
--             where the frames have no toggle to take: Blizzard's quest watch
--             frame is put up by the client's own QuestWatch_Update and there
--             is no key and no global that opens it, so that part cages and
--             takes nothing
--   Toggle    what to put on it, a named function at file scope in the part's
--             own file rather than a closure made here, because the swap runs
--             on a pass that goes once a second forever and a fresh closure a
--             second is garbage the collector walks. It is also what makes
--             "are we already holding it" a comparison
--   bindings  the names the client files that key under, where the part wants
--             to say which key in a sentence. Two names is the usual case:
--             the numbered one is what a modern Bindings.xml carries and the
--             bare one is the fallback
--   fallback  the letter the client ships with, for a client that answers none
--   bind      also take an override binding onto the part's own key button,
--             for a window with a secure button on it
--   window    the ns key of the part that draws the replacement, asked for
--             that button. Only the two that bind need it

--   place     what Describe calls where the frame went
--   off       what Describe says when this addon's own part is switched off.
--             Absent means the part says "on screen" instead, which is the
--             honest answer where the cage follows nothing but the switch
--   offKey    the key named while the switch is off, where the part spells it
--             out rather than asking the client
