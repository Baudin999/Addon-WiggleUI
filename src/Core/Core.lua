-- Core knows nothing about any feature. It holds the saved variables, the API
-- shims, the two drawing helpers every part uses, and the one registry every
-- feature signs into. Adding an eighth part to the addon must not require
-- editing this file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The registry
--
-- Each part calls ns.Register once, from its Feature.lua, and
-- hands over everything Core or the panel could want from it. Nothing else in
-- the addon reaches across parts to find out what exists.
--
--   name          the word that heads its slash help and its status line
--   order         a whole number, unique across the addon: where this part's
--                 tabs sit inside whichever group they named, and where its
--                 line sits in /wk status
--   defaults      merged into ns.db, the account-wide saved variables
--   charDefaults  merged into ns.dbc, this character's saved variables
--   switch        { key, label, available } the one boolean that decides
--                 whether this part puts anything on your screen
--   words         slash words this part answers to, word = function(arg, raw)
--   help          lines printed by /wk help
--   status        function returning one line for /wk status
--   lock          function applying ns.db.locked to this part's frames
--   reset         function putting this part's frames back where they started
--   panel         function(ui) building this part's sections of the panel
--   zooms         { { key, label, apply } } one entry per screen this part
--                 draws that can be sized on its own. key is the account
--                 setting holding the number, label is what the zoom page
--                 calls that screen, and apply is called after the number
--                 changes. A part with one screen registers one entry; the
--                 unit frames register several, because a party list and a
--                 nameplate are two screens by every measure but the folder
--                 they live in. window = true says this screen is one of the
--                 windows that shared uiSize before it was split, which is the
--                 only thing the one migration reads
--   showing       function(open) the options window opened or closed. For a
--                 part that draws something on the screen to say which of its
--                 rows the page is on, and has to stop when the page is gone
--
-- Every field except name is optional. A part with no frames has no lock.
--
-- order is whole and unique because it used to be neither. Two parts sat on 8
-- and a third on 7.6, so where they came out was whatever table.sort felt like
-- on the day, and the only way to find out was to open the window. A collision
-- is a login error now.
--
-- switch is the one boolean the panel draws itself, at the top of the part's
-- first page, and the rail reads to say which groups are doing something. It
-- exists because eleven parts each wrote their own check box for the same idea
-- and no two of them worded it the same way. available is optional and says the
-- part is not built on this character at all, which is Charge on a class whose
-- file named no openers. A part that answers no there opens no page and takes
-- no row on Start here: the switch is not greyed, it is not there.
--
-- Two scopes, because they are two different questions. A preference is yours
-- and belongs to the account. A record of what was in your action bars before
-- the loadout overwrote them belongs to the character whose bars they were,
-- and storing it account-wide is how one character's backup ends up written
-- over another character's bars.

--
-- Two calls, because the client has two and a unit is doing at most one of

-- a start, and this asks for a cast and falls back to a channel so every caller
-- gets one answer with a flag saying which it was.
--
-- Confirmed rather than remembered, on the bar every other shim in this file is
-- held to. Details is installed on the Era client and its framework used to
-- route both of these through LibClassicCasterino, which is the combat log
-- estimator every vanilla cast bar was built on because vanilla answered only
-- for you. That branch is switched off in `Libs/DF/externals.lua` under the
-- comment "disable this for now, as it appears to be working now through API
-- changes", and what it falls back to is UnitCastingInfo and UnitChannelInfo
-- called unguarded. So both clients answer for a unit that is not you. Probed
-- all the same, because nothing installed here proves it for 2.5.6 and a
-- feature that silently draws nothing is the failure this addon keeps hitting.

-- carries a castID and a channel does not, so notInterruptible is the eighth

-- borrow it. Questie is not the client, so this is not an API shim: it is the
-- one place that knows another addon's loader by name.

-- The rule that keeps it one place is in scripts/check.sh. Outside this file,

-- QuestieDB with QueryItemSingle on it and nil means what it says.
--
-- Functions only, deliberately. A data field like currentQuestlog is filled in
-- after login rather than at load, so refusing the module over one would report
-- a missing Questie for a quest log that is merely not built yet. A caller that
-- reads a field checks that field itself, next to the read.

-- compiled minutes after login and an answer taken too early would be wrong for
-- the rest of the session.

-- The one part of Questie that promises not to move, or nil, asked for by the
-- call you mean to make.
--
-- `Public/` is new in v11 and its README says what nothing else in that addon
-- says: what is exposed on `Questie.API` is stable and safe to use. The probe
-- above cannot reach a line of it. It asks QuestieLoader for a module by name,
-- and `Questie.API` is a plain table written onto the `Questie` global by
-- Modules/VersionCheck.lua, which the loader has never heard of.
--
-- So the same three questions as above, asked of the other half of that addon:
-- the global, the field, the call. Nil for each, and nothing said.
--
-- The table comes back rather than the function, because `isReady` is the
-- fourth stable thing on it and it is a boolean field rather than a call. A
-- caller that wants it reads it off what this hands back, next to the read,
-- which is the rule the header above sets for currentQuestlog.
--
-- v6 is what the name argument is for. That install has a `Questie` global and
-- no `Public/` at all, so the field is what tells the two apart on a client
-- where the addon is running perfectly well and simply predates the promise.

-- The fourth door, and the only one that is somebody else's art rather than

-- reads Questie's own icon frames and the texture is on them. The quest log's
-- map is built out of the database instead, so it has the number Questie would
-- have drawn and none of the art, and a mark that has to be found on a
-- hillside is worth more than a coloured square.
--
-- Three shapes go in, because Questie has named an icon three ways across the
-- two versions this addon ships for and the caller should not have to know
-- which install it is on.
--
--   a number   v11's own `Questie.ICON_TYPE_*`, which is what an objective
--              carries.
--
--   a name     "slay", "loot", "complete" and the rest. What a caller asks for
--              when the data says what kind of thing it is and not which icon
--              Questie picked. The name is turned into the number first, for
--              the reason below, and only falls through to `Questie.icons`
--              where the number is not there to be had.
--
--   a path     v6 had neither table. It wrote the paths onto plain globals at
--              load, `ICON_TYPE_SLAY` and the five beside it, and put those
--              strings straight onto the objective. So a string with a
--              backslash in it is already the answer and is handed back.
--

-- and they disagree on the icons the player has changed: Questie lets a handful
-- be replaced in its options and writes the replacement into `usedIcons` alone.

-- question, and the whole point of asking Questie for the art is that there is
-- only one.

-- The professions
--
-- Two windows, because this client has two of them. Every profession but
-- enchanting draws in the trade skill window and answers the GetTradeSkill
-- names; enchanting draws in the craft window and answers a parallel set of
-- names, and on Classic Era beast training draws there as well. Neither set
-- answers for the other's window, so both are shimmed and the caller walks
-- whichever one is open.
--
-- Here rather than in Comfort/Reagents.lua, which is the only caller, for the
-- reason the merchant block above gives: a part may not probe the client for a
-- call it means to make, because whether the call is there is a fact about the
-- build and not about the feature.
--
-- The one real difference between the two windows is where a row says what
-- kind of row it is, and it is the whole reason these are eleven functions
-- rather than a table of names. GetTradeSkillInfo answers name, type,
-- available, expanded. GetCraftInfo answers name, sub spell, type, available,
-- expanded, so the type is third and the expanded flag fifth. Both call a
-- category row "header" and neither says so anywhere but in that one slot, so
-- a caller reading the wrong position would take every category for a recipe
-- and every recipe for a category and would find no reagents at all, quietly.
-- The pair each window answers is normalised here to that type and that flag,
-- which is all a caller wants of a row.
--
-- Both windows are asked for their profession through the same guard. The
-- trade skill call answers the string "UNKNOWN" and three zeroes when no
-- window is open rather than answering nothing, and nothing says the craft
-- call is different, so UNKNOWN is read as no window on both sides. A caller
-- filing reagents under a profession called UNKNOWN would be a caller filing

-- The binding set moving under us
--
-- An override binding sits on top of the binding set rather than inside it,
-- and the client throws every override away each time it builds that set
-- again. It does that at Okay and at Cancel in the Key Bindings panel, at a
-- switch between the account's keys and this character's, and once during
-- login after PLAYER_LOGIN has already run.
--
-- That last one is the whole bug. A key taken at PLAYER_LOGIN was dropped a
-- moment later by a build nothing here was watching for, so every key this
-- addon took was dead before the player could press it and rebinding it by
-- hand was the only thing that appeared to work. It appeared to work because a rebind is
-- the first take the client has not already thrown away.
--
-- So a key taken with SetOverrideBindingClick has to be taken again whenever
-- the set moves, and UPDATE_BINDINGS is what the client fires when it does.
-- Every file that takes one registers the pass that takes it again.
--
-- The pass waits a frame rather than running on the event, because putting a
-- key back fires UPDATE_BINDINGS itself and Buttons/Bars.lua answers that
-- event with a pass of its own. Running on the event would put this pass
-- inside every key that pass claims, a hundredfold for one binding change.
-- Waiting a frame collapses the whole storm into one run.
--
-- Nothing books a second pass from inside the first, because the latch below
-- turns the event away for as long as one is running. That is what makes every
-- key a pass puts back free rather than the start of the next pass.
--
-- One pass runs every registered take rather than only the one whose key
-- moved, because the event does not say which key that was and a take is a
-- handful of calls. A rebind is a function of no arguments that puts this
-- file's keys back, refuses in combat, and can be called at any time.

-- The screen the addon ships with
--
-- Core\Shipped.lua is generated by ./scripts/bake-defaults.sh out of a saved
-- variables file, and holds every setting the author's own screen differs from
-- the code's defaults on: where each window sits, which corner the floating
-- numbers come off and how long they stay, the cooldown row, the party and
-- raid blocks, the tooltip's scale. A fresh install and a reset both land on
-- that screen rather than in the middle of the monitor.
--
-- A generated file rather than an edited literal per setting, because it is a
-- capture and not an argument. The numbers in it were dragged into place, not
-- reasoned to, and a screen that is re-dragged next month has to be one
-- command rather than a walk through thirty features. The same trade Edit
-- Mode's Saved.lua makes, for the same reason.
--
-- Both scopes, out of the two saved variables files the client keeps. The
-- character's half is thin on purpose and the bake says why: every table under
-- a character is a record of what happened or a list keyed by a spell that
-- character has, so only the scalars come across.
--
-- What it will not carry is in scripts/bake-defaults.lua beside the reason:
-- the bar plan lives in Buttons\Which.lua, and the nameplate distance belongs
-- to the client.
--
-- Merged over the registry rather than into it, at the last moment before the
-- saved variables are filled in, so a feature still declares which settings it
-- owns and what type each one is. The capture only answers what one of them
-- should say on a screen nobody has touched yet.
--
-- Every key is checked, because a saved variables file carries settings this
-- addon dropped two releases ago and holds records that are nobody's default.
-- A capture that invented a key would be a setting no page can reach and no
-- reset can move; one that carried the purse would commit the gold on every
-- character to the repository.
