--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Where a Blizzard frame goes when this addon draws it instead
--
-- One frame, hidden at birth, that nothing can ever show. Every frame this
-- addon replaces is re-parented into it. A frame whose parent is hidden is not
-- drawn, whatever anybody calls on the frame itself, because visibility in this
-- client is a property of the parent chain rather than of a field on the frame.
--
-- That is the whole point, and it is a different guarantee from the one
-- ns.Strip makes.
--
-- ns.Strip puts a region's own Hide where its Show was, so the client's update
-- code calling Show cannot put it back. It is the right tool for a texture and
-- it has one hole that has now cost two bugs: `SetShown` is resolved in C and
-- never reads the Lua field, so every FrameXML path written as
-- `frame:SetShown(true)` walks straight past it. Core/BlizzHide.lua already
-- knew this and had a hook on the raid manager for exactly that reason, which is
-- a patch on one frame for a hole every frame has. `FCF_` uses SetShown on the
-- chat window, which is why `/logout` put the client's chat back on the screen,
-- and the cast bar mixin uses it on the target's bar, which is why there were
-- two cast bars for one cast with the switch on.
--
-- So the frames go somewhere the client cannot reach rather than being argued
-- with one method at a time. Show, SetShown, SetAlpha, a fade, an animation and
-- a layout pass all lose against a hidden parent, and none of them has to be
-- predicted in advance. That is what makes this the mechanism and ns.Strip the
-- second layer: both are applied, and only one of them can be defeated.
--
-- **Art does not come here.** A texture or a font string is a region of the
-- frame it was created on, and moving one would take it out of that frame's draw
-- order rather than off the screen. The three parts that strip a Blizzard region
-- one texture at a time, the nameplates, the bar art and the unit frame skin,
-- keep ns.Strip and are unaffected by this file.
--
-- **A secure action button does not come here either.** Buttons/Blizzard.lua
-- hides those with `statehidden` and Hide, and says in its own header why: the
-- client's bar controller calls methods on them from a call stack that goes on
-- to perform protected actions, and an addon's frame in that chain is a taint.
-- Nothing in this file is reached from that path.
--
-- **The one call that undoes a cage is hooked.** Only an explicit SetParent by
-- somebody else can take a frame out of this room, so every frame that comes in
-- gets a hook on that call and goes straight back on the same frame it was
-- moved. Show is hooked beside it, because that is the other handle anybody
-- reaches for and a Show on a caged frame is a frame whose own flag disagrees
-- with the picture.
--
-- **And everything held is swept anyway.** Attic.Sweep walks what the room holds
-- and puts back anything whose parent has drifted. It is the answer to the
-- client this addon has not met: a frame that would not take a hook, a build
-- where hooksecurefunc is not there at all. The hook makes it almost always find
-- nothing, which is what lets Core/BlizzHide.lua run the clock at a fifth
-- of the rate it used to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What this room will not take. Everything else the client makes is a frame of
-- some kind, and listing the two that are not is shorter and ages better than
-- listing the twenty that are: a client that grows a new frame type gets caged
-- correctly, and a client that grows a new art type is the failure this list
-- would have to be edited for anyway.
