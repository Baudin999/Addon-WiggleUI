--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The adventure guide
--
-- Two pages in one window. The front page is a shelf of cards, one per dungeon,
-- each wearing a painting of the place; click one and the window becomes that
-- dungeon, in the three columns a log has always had. Right click anywhere and
-- you are back on the shelf.
--
-- **Why two pages and not one column.** This window used to be a single page
-- with every boss in the game down its left edge: forty headers and two hundred
-- and thirty seven rows, drawn all at once on the argument that the question
-- anybody opens it with is "what should I be running now", and that is a
-- question about the whole list rather than about one dungeon.
--
-- The argument was right and the column was the wrong answer to it. Four
-- screens of scrolling, of which the thirty six lines that answer the question
-- are headers and the rest are names of bosses inside dungeons nobody has
-- chosen yet. A name is the thinnest description of a place there is, and the
-- middle and right columns spent the whole time showing one boss out of two
-- hundred that you had to reach the row of before you could see.
--
-- So the whole list is still the front page, and it is now a page of pictures.
-- Dungeons/Shelf.lua carries that argument in full.
--
-- **The second page is the window this used to be, minus the part that was
-- wrong.** Same three columns, same widths, the same scrolling list on the left
-- and the same item rows on the right, which is the quest log's shape and is
-- deliberate: a player who has learned one window has learned this one. What
-- changed is that the left column holds one dungeon's bosses instead of every
-- dungeon's, because the page you are on has already said which dungeon.
--
-- **The middle is the client's own map with the bosses on it.** The picture is
-- UI/Chart.lua, the same widget the quest log's map and the world map are drawn
-- on, and the marks are numbered squares matching the numbers down the left. A
-- dungeon is cut into floors and the strip under the map steps between them,
-- which is the same strip the quest log puts under a quest that spans two
-- zones.
--
-- **Nothing on the picture is invented, and that is the one thing to know about
-- this window.** No database on either client says where a boss stands inside
-- an instance; Questie, which knows where every creature in the outdoor world
-- is, files them all at {-1, -1}. So a mark appears the first time you loot
-- that boss, from where you were standing, and a dungeon you have never run
-- draws its map with no marks on it and a line underneath saying so.
-- Dungeons/Seen.lua carries the argument in full. The alternative was a
-- coordinate somebody remembered, which is a mark that is wrong on the one
-- screen you opened to find out where something is.
--
-- **The right column is what the boss drops, checked against the client.** The
-- book carries an item as an id and the name it had when it was baked, and a
-- row whose id resolves to a different name is dropped rather than drawn.
-- Dungeons/Loot.lua carries that; it is the difference between a window that
-- shows you the wrong sword and one that shows you one fewer.
--
-- **Right click is the way back, and it is not the only way back.** The gesture
-- is the world map's own: UI/Chart.lua has always stepped out of a picture on a
-- right click, and this window is the second reader of that. But a gesture
-- nothing on the screen mentions is a gesture half the people who use this will
-- never find, so there is also a button that says what it does. The gesture is
-- the shortcut and the button is the affordance, which is the way round those
-- two belong.
--
-- **Everything is built once.** The shelf holds a pool of cards, the list a
-- pool of rows, the board a pool of tiles and marks, and this client cannot
-- destroy a frame, so a window that rebuilt any of them on a click would leak a
-- dungeon's worth of frames per click all evening. It is the same argument the
-- quest log's two scrolling columns make one file across.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The window, sized for the picture in the middle of it.
--
-- It was 860 by 540, and at that size the two fixed columns and the four
-- margins took 518 of the width and the map got the 342 that were left. A
-- dungeon's art is 1002 by 668, so the picture was drawn at a third of the size
-- it was painted at: a room was about forty pixels across and the numbered mark
-- standing in it was sixteen. The one thing on the page you cannot read the
-- answer off in words was the smallest thing on it.
--
-- These numbers are what it takes for the map to be 662 wide, which is two
-- thirds of the art and close to twice what it was. The height is set to just
-- over what that shape asks for so the wheel still has a notch or two of room
-- to spend, and Window.Fit does that arithmetic rather than this comment: the
-- board is handed what is left after the heading, the floor strip and the two
-- lines of the sentence underneath.
--
-- Wider than the quest log at 810 and narrower than the world map at 1218,
-- which is the right place for it: the quest log's middle column is text, and
-- the world map draws a zone at the full size Blizzard draws one.
local WIDTH, HEIGHT = 1180, 660

-- The two fixed columns of the second page, the same numbers the quest log
-- uses. The middle takes whatever is left, which is the way round it has to be:
-- a dungeon name and an item name have a length the font decides, and a map
-- does not.
local LIST, DROPS = 250, 220

-- The button that goes back to the shelf, over the left column.
--
-- A word rather than a mark. Media/Glyphs.ttf carries a chevron pointing right
-- and none pointing left, and a back button is not worth re-cutting a font
-- over: "All dungeons" says where the press lands, which no arrow does.
local BACK, BACK_LABEL = 96, "All dungeons"

-- How much of the left column the button and the air under it take.
local UNDER = M.control + M.rowGap

-- One drop's picture, which is the width the right column reserves before the
-- words start so the names line up down one edge.
local SLOT = 22

-- The tick against a boss you have looted. A `V` because that is the letter
-- Media/Glyphs.ttf cuts the Font Awesome check onto, and a `V` is what a client
-- that refuses the font draws instead.
local TICK = "V"

-- How big a boss's mark is drawn on the picture, and how much bigger the one
-- you are reading is.
--
-- Bigger than a quest's camp because it carries a number, and the number is
-- what joins the mark to the row in the left column. A two digit boss number
-- at the glyph size needs about sixteen of square around it before the figure
-- stops touching the edge.
local MARK, PICKED = 16, 20

-- The most floors the strip under the map will offer. Blackrock Depths is the
-- deepest dungeon in the game at about ten, and a strip that wrapped onto a
