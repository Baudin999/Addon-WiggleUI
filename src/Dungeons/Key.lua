--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The key that opens the dungeon log
--
-- Shift-L out of the box, and any key you like in the settings window.
--
-- **It is a key of its own rather than a key taken off Blizzard.** The quest
-- log takes L and the world map takes M, because the client already has a
-- window for each of those and the honest thing to do is put the client's own
-- in the attic and stand in front of it. There is no adventure guide on either
-- of these clients. Nothing is being replaced, so nothing is being taken, and
-- the key is one this addon asks for.
--
-- Shift-L because L is the log key and this is the other log. A player who
-- knows L knows where to reach, and the modifier is what says which one.
--
-- **An override binding, never a real one.** SetBindingClick writes into the
-- live binding set, and the next SaveBindings, which the client's own Key
-- Bindings panel calls when you press Okay, would make that permanent and lose
-- whatever the player had on the key. An override sits on top of the set
-- instead, so a binding file is untouched even while this holds a key. It is
-- the same argument Charge/Icon.lua and Targeting/Switch.lua both make, and the
-- reason all three carry the displaced binding: the panel can then say what is
-- being shadowed rather than the player finding out.
--
-- **The button is not secure and does not need to be.** Opening a window is
-- ordinary Lua. The two keys above are on secure buttons because starting an
-- attack is protected and only a macro run off a hardware press may do it;
-- nothing here is. So this is a plain button with an OnClick, which also means
-- the key still works in combat, which for a window you open to read is the
-- whole point of it not being secure.
