-- The table
--
-- One row per ability, biggest first, in a window of its own.
--
-- It lived on a settings page first, and the argument for that was that this is
-- read between sessions rather than during a pull, so it did not need a frame
-- to place or an anchor to save. That argument was about where the numbers are
-- kept. It said nothing about how you get to them, and the way you got to them
-- was six clicks into a settings tree, which is where a readout goes to be
-- forgotten. The meter is the thing you are looking at when the question occurs
-- to you, so the meter is what opens this, and a window is what a thing opened
-- from the world has to be.
--
-- It costs nothing when it is shut. There is no frame until the first open, no
-- ticker at all, and the only repaint that is not a click is the one when you
-- drop combat with the window already up.
--
-- Three lines per row, because the numbers only mean something together. The
-- name and the damage are what you scan; the hit count and the crit rate say
-- whether the sample is worth anything yet; the miss breakdown is the line a
-- warrior actually acts on, because dodge is about where you were standing.
--
-- The bar behind a row is that ability's share of your damage, drawn the way
-- Meter/Window.lua draws its share bars and for the same reason: a column of
-- percentages is a column you have to read, and a bar is one you can rank at a
-- glance without reading anything.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The most rows the pool holds. Past this an ability is counted and simply not
-- drawn, which is a readout decision rather than a storage one: forty rows into
-- the ranking every share is a rounding error and the question has stopped
-- being "what am I doing" and started being "what have I ever done".
