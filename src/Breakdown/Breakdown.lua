-- What this character actually does
--
-- One row per ability, kept for as long as you keep it: how often it landed,
-- how often it crit, how often it was dodged, how much it did. It is the
-- question Details answers with a fight timeline and forty panes, asked the
-- other way round: not what happened in that pull, but what this character has
-- been doing for the last month.
--
-- **Counters, not history.** Every question this exists to answer is a ratio
-- over counters. Crit chance is crits over landed hits. Miss chance is the miss
-- table over attempts. What share of your damage is Thunder Clap is a sum over
-- rows. None of them needs the event that produced them kept, and keeping the
-- events is the one thing this could not afford: an evening of solo play is
-- tens of thousands of combat log lines, and the client writes saved variables
-- by serialising the whole table to Lua source at logout.
--
-- So the table grows with the number of abilities you use and never with the
-- number of swings you take. Forty spells across four level bands is well under
-- a hundred kilobytes of text, against megabytes for the history nobody asked
-- for.
--
-- **There is no flush, so there is nothing to flush.** The client writes saved
-- variables at logout, at a reload and on quitting, and an addon cannot ask for
-- a write in between; the only way to force one is ReloadUI, which is why Titan
-- puts a confirmation box in front of changing a profile. This file therefore
-- does not accumulate into a private table and copy it over at PLAYER_LOGOUT.
-- It counts directly into ns.dbc, which is the table the client serialises, so
-- there is no moment where the record exists only in memory and no logout hook
-- that can be forgotten. A crash costs the session either way.
--
-- **You, and not the group.** Meter/Meter.lua reads the same event and counts
-- everybody, deliberately, because it is answering what the group did to this
-- pull. This counts only what your own GUID did, and that is the one filter
-- that keeps the table bounded: counting the group would grow it by every
-- stranger you have ever been in a party with.
--
-- Nothing here is on a ticker. A counter moves when the log says so.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The key a white swing is filed under. Zero, because it is not a spell and has

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The level bands
--
-- A crit rate pooled across grey trash and a boss is the average of two
-- unrelated numbers. In this era the target's level drives miss and dodge hard,
-- and miss and dodge are half of what this table is for, so every counter is
-- filed under the band the target was in.
--
-- Four bands and not three, and the fourth is the honest one. The combat log
-- does not carry the target's level: you only ever learn it from a unit token,
-- which means the mob was your target or had a nameplate up. Anything you hit
-- without ever seeing lands in UNKNOWN rather than being quietly folded into
-- "same level", which is the answer that would silently flatter every rate in
-- the table.
