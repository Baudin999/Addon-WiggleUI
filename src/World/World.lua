--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The hover no frame in this addon owns
--
-- Every other hover in WarriorKit is answered by the thing under the cursor. A
-- feed row, a nag square, an action slot and a filter chip all have an OnEnter,
-- and UI/Tip.lua replaces what they would have said. A creature in the 3D world
-- has none of that. The cursor is over WorldFrame, the client resolves the
-- `mouseover` token by itself, fills its own tooltip by itself and shows it by
-- itself, and there is no script anywhere in that sequence for an addon to
-- write. The same is true of a nameplate: UnitFrames/EnemyBars.lua calls
-- EnableMouse(false) on its bar precisely so the plate underneath keeps the
-- click, so the frame the pointer is actually over is Blizzard's, not ours.
--
-- So this part is built the other way round from the rest of the addon. It does
-- not intercept a hover; it hears that one happened, opens the addon's own box
-- for it, and asks UI/Scan.lua to hold the client's box down for as long as
-- ours is up. Two halves, and the second is the one with the sharp edge: the
-- reasoning for how narrowly Blizzard's tooltip is hidden, and what a player
-- loses if that goes wrong, is written where the code is, in UI/Scan.lua.
--
-- **Any mouseover, not only one in the world.** A unit frame sets the token
-- too, and this opens for those as well, which is exactly what the client does
-- and is why no test on the mouse focus is worth writing. The one seam it
-- leaves is the aura squares under the skinned target block: hovering one opens
-- its own box over this one, and leaving it closes both, so the unit's box does
-- not come back until the pointer finds a different unit. That is a smaller
-- wrong than a tooltip that guesses which frames belong to whom.
--
-- **The event says when a hover begins and not when it ends.**
-- UPDATE_MOUSEOVER_UNIT fires when the token resolves to somebody new. Nothing
-- fires reliably when the pointer slides off onto empty ground, and a box that
-- opens on a mob and stays there after you have looked away is worse than no
-- box. So there is a ticker, it runs only while the box is on screen, and the
-- one question it asks is whether the mouseover still exists.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

local UNIT = "mouseover"

-- A tenth of a second, which is the same step the enemy bars run at. It is the
-- delay between looking away and the box going, and anything shorter is asking
-- UnitExists more often than a person can notice.

-- The mob the box on screen is about.
--
-- UPDATE_MOUSEOVER_UNIT does not fire once per hover. It fires whenever the
-- token resolves, which a moving mob, a moving camera and a mob that dies and
-- leaves a corpse under your pointer all do again for the same creature, and
-- each one built the whole box a second time: a unit scan of Blizzard's tooltip,
-- every band laid out again and the suppression armed on top of the box it was
-- already holding down. The same guid is the same box.
local looking

local suppressed

-- What the addon has to say about the thing under the cursor.
--
-- The head band is the client's own lines about the unit, which are already
-- right and already localised, and the extra band is whatever other parts
-- registered against the kind. The title is the fallback under that, the way it
-- is on every item hover in the addon: a client with no SetUnit answers no
-- lines at all, and a box carrying a threat reading over an unnamed thing is
-- worse than a box carrying a name.
--
-- No hint line. The box follows your pointer around the world, so a standing
-- footnote about the switch that turns it off is on screen the whole time you
-- are playing, and the panel and the slash word both already say it.

-- Whether the box on screen is the one this file put there.
--
-- **The addon has one tooltip and every hover in it draws in that one frame.**
-- A bag square, a unit frame, a feed row: each of them opens the same box on
-- itself and takes it down again on the way out, and none of them tells this
-- file that it did. So "our box is up" is not something this file may remember.
-- It is something it has to ask, and the two calls below are the whole of the
-- question.
--

-- still shown and belongs to nobody: UI/Tip.lua drops the owner the moment the
-- pointer leaves what it was describing.

-- `now` takes the box down on the spot rather than letting it linger. Two

-- screen puts a zone between you and it, and the setting going off means the
-- addon is not describing mobs any more. A second of a sentence about either is
-- a second of a sentence about nothing.
-- **And the box goes only if it is still ours.** Every other line here is this
-- file's own state and is put back whatever is on screen, but the last one
-- reaches into the frame every hover in the addon shares. A creature that stops
-- existing while the pointer is over a bag square is this state coming down and
-- somebody else's tooltip staying up, and the hover record inside UI/Tip.lua is
