--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What the auction house thinks it is worth
--
-- One number for an item link, and the name of whoever answered.
--
-- **The client will not say.** There is no API in this game for the going rate
-- of an item. The auction house is a server query with a scan behind it, the
-- result lives in whichever addon did the scanning, and every one of those
-- addons keeps it somewhere different. So this file asks them, in order, and
-- takes the first answer.
--
-- **Which is a dependency this addon refuses to have.** Nothing here is
-- required, nothing here is suggested in a TOC, and a player with none of these
-- installed loses one line of one tooltip and is told nothing about it. That is
-- the whole contract: an addon that is present is read, an addon that is absent
-- is not mentioned, and no path in the loot feed cares which.
--
-- **The answer says who gave it.** A price with no source on it is a number the
-- player cannot check, cannot age and cannot argue with. "Auctionator 12g 40s"
-- can be looked up in Auctionator; "12g 40s" can only be believed. That is also
-- why the first provider wins rather than the highest or the average of them:
-- two scanners disagreeing is a real thing, and picking one to name is honest
-- where averaging two is a number nobody's addon holds.
--
-- Nothing here is on a ticker and nothing here is cached per item. A price is
-- read when a tooltip opens, which is a moment, and the moment is the only time
-- the answer matters.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The string an addon that wants one is handed as the caller's name. Auctionator
-- asks for it so it can attribute a query, and it wants the same string every
-- time rather than one built per call.
local CALLER = ADDON

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The scanners, in the order they are asked
--
-- Newest interface first within an addon, because Auctionator carries both and
-- the old one is a compatibility shim over the new. Between addons the order is
-- how likely the addon is to be the one doing the scanning on a classic realm,
-- which is a judgement and is written down here rather than argued at each
-- call site.
--
-- Every entry is a name, a test that the addon is here and carries the shape
-- this file is about to use, and a read. The test is separate from the read so
-- a scanner that is installed but has never scanned reports as installed:
-- "Auctionator, and it has no price for this item" and "no auction addon at
-- all" are different states with different fixes, and a probe that merged them
-- would tell the player to install something they already have.
