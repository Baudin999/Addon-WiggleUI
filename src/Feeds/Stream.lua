--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A feed, put on the screen
--
-- UI/Feed.lua draws a column of things that happened and knows nothing else:
-- not where it sits, not whether it is switched on, not how big the player
-- asked for it. This is the seam between that widget and the addon around it.
-- One frame on UIParent, on the pixel grid, movable while the addon is
-- unlocked, with one feed filling it and a block of settings behind it.
--
-- It exists because there are two of these and there will be more. The loot
-- stream and the combat log differ in what they capture and in what a row says;
-- they do not differ in any of the twelve things below, and two copies of
-- twelve things is two places to fix a drag that saves the wrong anchor.
--
-- **Settings are found by name, not passed in.** A stream is built with a
-- prefix and every setting it reads is that prefix and a word: lootFeed,
-- lootFeedRows, lootFeedWidth. The names are resolved once here rather than
-- concatenated at each read, so nothing builds a string to look a setting up,
-- and Feature.lua registers exactly the eight keys this file will ask for.
--
-- **On and shown are two settings, not one.** They were one, called after the
-- prefix, and it meant the only way to get a feed off the screen was to stop it
-- recording: hide it and it stopped collecting, so what came back when you
-- wanted it again was an empty column. Hiding a feed and switching it off are
-- different requests and now they are different keys. `lootFeed` is whether it
-- collects, which is what the capture files read before they do any work, and
-- `lootFeedShown` is whether you can see it. Off implies hidden, because a
-- frozen list left on screen reads as a bug rather than as a setting.
--
-- **Locked is the normal state.** Unlocked draws an outline and a name above
-- it, which is Meter/Window.lua's trade and is here for the same reason: a feed
-- that has nothing in it yet is otherwise a piece of empty screen you have to
-- find from memory.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The eleven settings a stream owns beyond the one named after its prefix, as
-- the words that follow it. Named here so Feeds/Feature.lua registers the same
-- list this file reads and neither can drift without the other failing to find
-- a key.
--
-- The last four arrived together and are all one subject: how much of a window
-- a feed is. Icon is the size of the picture on a row and therefore the height
-- of the row. Header is the word over the column. Edge is the hairline round
-- the whole thing. Filters is the strip of chips, which is the loot feed's and
-- which a stream with no chips ignores rather than special cases.

	"Rows", "Width", "Zoom", "Alpha", "Mouse", "Shown", "Point",

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The status strip
--
-- An optional row along the bottom of a stream, under a hairline, holding three
-- short readings: one at each end and one in the middle. A stream that is given
-- no onStatus has none of it and is the frame it always was.
--
-- **Why the strip has a beat and the feed does not.** Everything above it
-- changes when something happens to you, and the header of UI/Feed.lua refuses
-- a ticker on exactly that ground. A reading is the other kind of number: gold
-- an hour moves because the clock moved, and nothing fires an event when a
-- minute passes. So the strip carries the only OnUpdate in this part, one
-- second apart, and it is a child of the stream frame, which means the client
-- stops calling it the moment the feed is hidden.

-- a 6 closed and the waist of an 8 filled in on the one line in the window that
