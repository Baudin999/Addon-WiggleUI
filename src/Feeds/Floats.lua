-- Drops, floated
--
-- What you just picked up, sliding in from the edge of the screen, resting a
-- moment beside the middle of it and fading. Several at once come in one under
-- the other, a beat apart, and climb when the one above them goes.
--
-- This is the first caller of ns.Ck.Float and it is deliberately the smallest
-- one that proves the library: it builds a row, hands it to a lane and takes it
-- back afterwards, and it does not know that anything moved.
--
-- **Where the settings live.** Every number the message is made of is one, and
-- all of them are read here. The library takes each as a spec field and reads
-- ns.db for none of them, which is what keeps it liftable into an addon of its
-- own, so this file is the whole of the join between a slider on a page and a
-- message crossing a screen.
--
-- **Why it reads chat rather than the loot window,** and why the sentence is
-- taken apart by the client's own format strings rather than by text typed
-- here, is written out at the head of Feeds/Loot.lua. This is the second reader
-- of ns.LootLine and it asks the same question through the same door.
--
-- **Why it is not a branch inside that file.** The feed is a column in a
-- window you open. This is a thing that happens on your screen while you are
-- looking at a mob. They answer to different switches, and a drop that the
-- feed's quality chips have filtered out is still a drop you want to see float
-- past. One event, two readers, no shared state.
--
-- **Why the rows are pooled.** A pull drops six items in a second and the lane
-- hands each row back the moment it has faded, so the pool settles at whatever
-- the screen held at once and never allocates again. Nothing here is on a tick,
-- but the lane's reflow is, and a row it releases must not be a row somebody
-- then rebuilds.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The defaults, which are the spec this was built to: in from forty pixels
-- inside the right edge, invisible, to forty pixels short of the centre, solid,
-- in half a second; a second on screen; a hundred pixels down from the top.
--
-- Every one of them is a setting now, and the reason is that none of them is a
-- fact. Where the eye is on a screen, how long a caption has to be up to be
-- read, and how much of the middle a message may cross are answers about a
-- monitor and a person, not about loot, and the numbers below are one person's.
-- ns.Ck.Float took them as spec fields from the first day for exactly this: the
-- library reads no setting and this file reads them all.
--
-- One number is missing from the list and one is on it that looks like it
-- should not be. The height is worked out rather than stored: a row is as tall
-- as the tallest thing on it, because a height beside an icon size is two
-- settings that have to agree and the one somebody forgets to move writes over
-- the message underneath. The width is stored rather than measured, because the
-- lane rests a message by its far edge and a row that sized itself to the name
-- in it would be a column whose left edge moved with every drop.
--
-- The picture is fifty pixels by default, two and a half times what the loot
-- feed's column draws, and the name is twenty rather than the twelve every
-- panel in the addon uses. Neither is UI.Metric and neither should be: those
-- numbers are the size of a control in a window, and this is a caption on the
-- world read at arm's length in the second before it goes.

-- sizes on screen at the same time. This is five calls on an event that fires
-- when something drops, not on a tick.
--
-- The rim's four edges are given a length as well as a thickness, which almost
-- nowhere else in the addon does. ns.EdgeSize says why: an edge pinned to two
-- corners takes its length from a frame that was laid out once, and this frame
-- is resized under it every drop.

	--
	-- Blended, which is to say left alone. This was drawn additively for a
	-- while, because an item icon is a painting with no alpha channel in it at
	-- all and a blend has nothing to make transparent, so a drop crossed the
	-- world as a black tile. Adding hid the tile by making dark pixels
	-- contribute nothing to what was behind them, and it cost the picture: on
	-- snow, where the destination is already near white, there is no headroom
	-- left to add into and every drop washed out to a pale ghost.
	--
	-- The rim is the answer instead. An opaque square is what the action bar,
	-- the bag slot and the client's own loot toast all draw, and a square with
	-- a line round it reads as an icon rather than as a hole in the world. It
	-- is also somewhere to put the grade, which the name beside it was carrying
	-- alone.
	--
	-- A frame rather than a bare texture, because ns.Outline pins its four
	-- edges to a frame's corners and the picture needs corners of its own. The

	-- where one stored texel is one screen pixel, the icon setting is meant to
	-- sit on that list, and an inset takes 50 to 48 and puts the picture
	-- halfway between two stored copies. The rim is a hairline and it is

	-- longer closes up the face's own counters; a shadow is chosen anyway,
	-- because a rim reads as a health number over a mob and this is a caption
	-- that arrives and leaves.
	--
	-- The two sizes handed to UI.Label here are replaced by Dress before the
