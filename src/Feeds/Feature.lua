-- The float's own rows

-- read and how much of the middle a message may cross are answers about a
-- monitor and a person.
--
-- The two sides both work, and the second offset is why that took saying. A
-- message is pinned by the corner nearest the edge it came from, so the entry
-- offset is a distance to that corner and needs no width; the rest offset is
-- measured to the far edge and has the row's width taken off it, which is what
-- stops the message crossing the centre rather than stopping at it. Both are
-- resolved inside ns.Ck.Float at the moment of a push, so the numbers below
-- mean the same thing on either side and on any monitor.
