--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What dropped
--
-- Every item that reaches you, as a row: the icon, the name in the item's own
-- quality colour, how many of it there were, and why you want it.
--
-- **The last of those is not this file's.** Core/Need.lua answers it, and what
-- happens here is that its colour goes round the icon, its phrase goes in the
-- dim middle column and its sentence goes on the hover. A quality colour says
-- what the game thinks an item is worth and cannot say that eight of this one
-- finishes a quest, which is the whole of what a loot feed is read for.
--
-- Only a quest reason reaches the column, because only a quest reason has a
-- number in it. A reagent's answer is a profession's name in the player's own
-- language, which measures 104 units against a column that is never wider than
-- 81, so it is a green ring on the row and a word on the hover.
--
-- **Why this reads chat rather than the loot window.** The obvious source is
-- the loot window itself, and it is the wrong one twice over. Comfort/Loot.lua
-- empties a corpse at LOOT_READY before the window is ever drawn, so on this
-- addon's own default there is no window to read; and a window says what is on
-- the corpse rather than what ended up in your bags, which for a group is a
-- different list. CHAT_MSG_LOOT is the server telling you what you actually
-- got, it fires for a quest reward and a crafted item as well as a corpse, and
-- it is the only source that is right in all of those cases.
--
-- **Why the sentences are built rather than typed.** The message is a localised
-- format string with the link poked into it, and the client hands the addon the
-- same format strings it used. Turning LOOT_ITEM_SELF_MULTIPLE into a pattern
-- means a German client is read by German rules without this file knowing a
-- word of German. Typing "You receive loot:" here would be an addon that works
-- on one locale and silently captures nothing on the rest.
--
-- Nothing here is on a ticker. An item drops when it drops.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The quality palette, which lives in UI/Theme.lua.
--
-- It was written here and moved when the quest log's reward column became its
-- second reader. The tables are the same tables, which matters: every guard in
-- UI/Feed.lua compares a colour by table identity, so a palette read fresh out
-- of the client on each row would fail every one of those guards and repaint a
-- colour that had not changed. Taken into a local at load, the same as the
-- palette and the metrics above it.
local QUALITY = ns.UI.Quality

-- The number of qualities the chips and the filter know about, which is the
-- five the game grades an item on. Six and seven exist and are the heirloom and
-- the artifact, neither of which drops on this client; anything at that end of
-- the scale is drawn in its own colour above and filtered with the epics.
local QUALITIES = 4

-- What class the client files a quest item under. Comfort/Clutter.lua reads the
-- same number off the same call and says so in its own header; this is the
-- second reader, and the two are deliberately not sharing a constant, because
-- one of them scanning your bags and the other reading a loot message are not
-- one decision.
local QUEST_CLASS = 12

-- The ring round a quest item's icon, and the chip that says whether those
-- items are drawn.
--
-- Orange rather than the heading gold beside it. Gold is what the coin rows are
-- and what the account's own accent is, and a quest marker in that colour is a
-- marker you have to work out. This is the only orange in the addon.
local QUEST = { 0.98, 0.55, 0.15 }

-- The three letters the glyph face draws the chips' marks on. A gem for the
-- thing that grades an item, the quest bang and a stack of coins. The fourth
-- chip draws the ring an item wears rather than a glyph for it. Named rather
-- than written at the call site because scripts/bake-glyphs.sh is what decides
-- which letter carries which mark, and a literal `*` sitting in a table would
-- give nobody reading this file a way to find that out.
local GEM, BANG, COINS = "*", "!", "$"

-- What the client calls each quality in its own language. ITEM_QUALITY0_DESC
-- and its siblings are the strings the client's own tooltips use, so a player
-- reading "Uncommon" on a chip reads the same word the item does; the English
-- list behind them is for a client that carries neither.
--
-- Here rather than in Feeds/Feature.lua, where it was, because the chips over
-- the rows name a quality and the panel page names the same quality, and the
-- two of them reading different tables is how one ends up saying "Poor" while
-- the other says "Grey".
local QUALITY_WORDS = { [0] = "Poor", "Common", "Uncommon", "Rare", "Epic" }

end

local COIN = "Interface\\Icons\\INV_Misc_Coin_01"

-- What the client draws where an item's icon should be and cannot say which.
-- Named rather than left nil, because a texture of nil is a blank square and a
-- question mark is the client's own way of saying it does not know yet.
local UNKNOWN = "Interface\\Icons\\INV_Misc_QuestionMark"

-- How long two of the same item are one pickup rather than two rows.
--
-- Sixty seconds, and it is a number rather than the whole ring for the reason
-- Feed:Fold is bounded at sixteen entries. Bandages come off a craft one a
-- second and belong on one row; a vendor run an hour ago is a different
-- afternoon and belongs on its own. The window is not a setting, because a
-- slider on it would be the third control over what this column shows and the
-- header over the filter is an argument against the second.
local FOLD_WINDOW = 60

-- Need/Need.lua's word for the one reason this feed draws differently from the
-- other two. Written as the word rather than tested some other way, because the
-- brightness of a ring is the only thing in this file that has to tell the three
-- answers apart and the word is what the call hands over.
local TRASH = "trash"



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What the column shows
--
-- Eight chips over the rows: one per quality, two that override them and one
-- for coin. Each is on or off, each says which of them it is by its colour, and
-- between them they are the whole of what is drawn.
--
-- **The feed records everything either way.** There was a quality floor here
-- and it worked at the door: an item under it never became a row and could not
-- be got back by changing your mind. That is the wrong end to filter at for a
-- window whose whole job is answering "what did I just get", and it was also
-- the second control doing this job, which is one more than a feature should
-- have. It is gone. Everything that drops is written down, the chips decide
-- what you are looking at, and turning one back on brings its history with it.
--
-- **A quest item is not a quality.** It is white, the same white as a stack of
-- linen, so what says it is the ring rather than a colour of its own, and its
-- chip is an override rather than a seventh tier: on, a quest item is drawn
-- whatever its own quality chip says. That is the combination that makes the
-- feed useful while questing, which is turning the whites off and still seeing
-- the five wolf livers you need.
--
-- **A reason is not a quality either, and it is the same override.**
-- Need/Need.lua answers quest, skill or trash for an item and the row wears
-- that answer as the ring round its icon, so this chip is that field: on, a row
-- with a ring is drawn whatever its quality chip says. Greys and whites off
-- with it on is the column cut down to the handful of things this hour that you
-- were actually looking for.
--
-- The quest chip is a special case of this one and stays. Somebody who wants
-- quest items and not reagents has to be able to say so, and the two chips
-- together are what says it.
--
-- Trash is one of the three, so a grey the loot filter would have left comes
-- through this chip with the grey chip off. That is the point of it rather than
-- a leak. Comfort/Loot.lua empties a corpse before a window is drawn, so this
-- feed is the only place a rule set too tight is ever found out, and the row
-- stays quiet at that: trash sets no `look`, so its ring rests with the stripe
-- instead of being held at full.
--
-- It wears none of the three reason colours, because it stands for all three
-- and a chip in the orange would be claiming the quest chip's job. The mark is
-- the ring itself, a hollow square, which is the thing on the row this switch
-- decides about.
--
-- The five qualities are one saved number rather than five saved booleans. A
-- table of five would be five keys the defaults have to backfill and five
-- things a reset has to walk; a bitmask is one of each, and nothing outside
-- this pair of functions ever sees it.

-- two rings for two reasons would be a row with two rings on it.
--
-- A reagent leaves the column empty, because Core/Need.lua gives it no phrase
-- and no row can hold the one it would have given. That is the ring carrying a
-- reason on its own, which is what the ring already does for trash everywhere
-- else this answer is drawn.
--
-- Asked with no loot slot, because CHAT_MSG_LOOT is the server saying what
-- reached your bags and the corpse behind it is gone by the time it arrives.
-- Trash still answers: Comfort/Loot.lua wrote down what the filter refused at
-- the moment it refused it, and Need/Need.lua reads that back by link. This is
-- the only window in the addon that ever sees a slot the filter binned, and a
-- rule set too tight is otherwise a rule nobody finds out about.
--
-- Trash is also the one reason that does not light the ring. It is the
-- commonest answer of the three and the one nobody is looking for, so it is
-- drawn at the row's own brightness with the stripe rather than held at full: a
-- column of greys each wearing a bright ring is this feed back where it started,
-- which is the argument the chips already won.
--
-- The ring falls back to the quest colour for an item the client files as a
-- quest item. Core/Need.lua matches an objective by the name the client writes
-- on it and says so in its own header, and the handful whose objective is
-- worded differently from the item would otherwise lose a ring the feed has
-- drawn round them since it was written.
--
-- The ring stays at full while the stripe beside it rests. The stripe is a
-- grade and a column of grades is worth reading as a ribbon; the ring is the
-- one thing on the row telling you to look, and a thing telling you to look at
-- three fifths strength is furniture. `look` is what UI/Feed.lua reads for
