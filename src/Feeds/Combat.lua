--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What just happened to you
--
-- The same column as the loot stream, fed by the combat log instead: one row
-- per thing that landed, newest at the top, with the icon of whatever did it,
-- what it was, who the other party was, and the number.
--
-- **A row has to answer three questions and it used to answer one.** The rule
-- was: draw the spell's name where there is one and the other party's name
-- where there is not. That reads "Overpower 321" and "Plains Creeper 26" as the
-- same shape, and neither one says who was on the other end of it. So the name
-- column is always what happened, a spell or the client's own word for a swing,
-- and the dim middle column is always who, with "on" for something you did and
-- "from" for something done to you. The direction is in the stripe as well, in
-- colour, but colour on its own is a thing a colourblind player does not have.
--
-- **A critical carries a mark, not just a colour.** The number reads 871! and
-- draws in gold. Gold alone was the whole signal and it was the same mistake
-- one level down: the moment the feed exists to show you cannot be the one
-- carried by hue alone.
--
-- **It is about you and nothing else.** The log names every creature in range,
-- including the other party fighting the pack next door, and a feed that drew
-- all of it would be the client's own combat log tab, which is the thing nobody
-- reads. So a row is made only where you or your pet is one of the two ends of
-- the event. Meter/Meter.lua answers the other question, what the whole group
-- did over a fight, and the two share no state on purpose: one is a running
-- total and one is a list of moments.
--
-- **The positions are the contract.** CombatLogGetCurrentEventInfo hands over
-- twenty-one values in a fixed order and the meaning of the twelfth onwards
-- depends on the subevent. A swing puts its amount at twelve; a spell puts its
-- id, name and school there and its amount at fifteen. That is read here once,
-- in a table, rather than at each site, and it is the reason this file is
-- separate from the one that draws the rows.
--
-- **Nothing is on a ticker.** A row arrives when the log says so.
--
-- **Collecting and being on screen are two settings.** `combatFeed` is whether
-- this file does anything at all, and it decides whether this file is
-- subscribed to ns.CombatLog, so a feed that is off costs nothing at all per
-- combat log event: the addon is not on the event. `combatFeedShown` only
-- decides whether you can see the column, and a feed hidden with that one keeps
-- filling: what you get when you bring it back is the last four hundred things
-- that happened rather than a blank. That matters because the two are nowhere
-- near the same price. Reaching the end of this file and pushing a row costs
-- roughly thirty times what turning an event away at the top costs, and nearly
-- all of that thirty is UI/Feed.lua repainting the column. Feeds/Stream.lua
-- puts the hidden feed's widget to sleep for exactly that reason.
