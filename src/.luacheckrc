	"WarriorKitMeter",
	-- your own cast bar. Named for the same reason the swing bars below it are:
	-- the harness has to measure what was drawn, and a bar that is empty almost
	-- all of the time has to be findable from a macro when it has wandered off
	-- the screen.
	"WarriorKitPlayerCast",
	-- the swing timer's frame, holding a gauge per hand. Named for the same
	-- reason the meter is: scripts/harness.lua has to measure what was drawn,
	-- and Swing/Gauges.lua handing out a reference to its own bars would be a
	-- worse seam than a global the client makes anyway.
	"WarriorKitSwing",
	-- the experience and reputation rails. Named for the reason the swing bars
	-- are: scripts/harness.lua has to measure what was drawn, and a frame that
	-- is one thin line along the bottom edge of the screen has to be findable
	-- from a macro once somebody has dragged it somewhere else.
	"WarriorKitProgress",
	-- the buff nag's row. Named for the reason the meter and the swing bars
	-- are: the row is hidden almost all the time, so a row that has wandered
	-- off the screen has to be findable from a macro, and scripts/harness.lua
	-- has to measure what was drawn without Buffs/Nag.lua handing out its pool.
	"WarriorKitBuffs",
	-- the block the skin draws over each of the three Blizzard unit frames.
	-- Named so a block that lands in the wrong place can be measured from a
	-- macro or from scripts/harness.lua without UnitFrames/Block.lua handing out
	-- a reference to its own entry tables. Named in Skin.lua's SPECS and read
	-- from there rather than written as a literal, so
	-- luacheck never sees the write; listed here because the game makes the
	-- global and the README says every one of those is written down.
	"WarriorKitSkinPlayer",
	"WarriorKitSkinTarget",
	"WarriorKitSkinToT",
	-- The party and raid list: the frame you drag, and the secure group header
	-- hung off it. Both named for the reason the three blocks above are, and the
	-- header for one more: it is a Blizzard template doing the work, so a list
	-- that came out in the wrong order has to be readable from a macro one
	-- attribute at a time.
	"WarriorKitGroup",
	"WarriorKitGroupHeader",
	"WarriorKit_MarkSkull",
	"WarriorKit_MarkCross",
	"WarriorKit_MarkMoon",
	-- the chat window, and the key that puts the cursor in its line. The frame
	-- is named for the same reason the meter is: so a window that has wandered
	-- off the screen can be found from a macro or from scripts/harness.lua
	-- without Chat/Window.lua handing out a reference to its own tables.
	"WarriorKitChat",
	-- the column of rooms down its left. Named for the reason the aura rows
	-- are: a column that has laid itself out wrongly has to be measurable from
	-- a macro and from scripts/harness.lua without Chat/Window.lua handing out
	-- a reference to its own tables.
	"WarriorKitChatRooms",
	-- the box a room is copied out of. Named so Escape closes it through
	-- UISpecialFrames, which is a list of names.
	"WarriorKitChatCopy",
	-- the button the enter key is bound onto while Blizzard's chat window is
	-- hidden. SetOverrideBindingClick binds to a name rather than to a frame,
	-- which is the whole reason it has one.
	"WarriorKitChatEnterButton",
	"WarriorKit_ChatEnter",
	-- the two feeds, and the tooltip they open. All three are named for the
	-- reason the meter and the chat window are: a frame that has wandered off
	-- the screen has to be findable from a macro, and scripts/harness.lua has to
	-- measure what was drawn without UI/Feed.lua handing out its row pool. The
	-- scanner is different and is not optional: a GameTooltip's own lines are
	-- reachable only as globals built from its name, so a nameless one has text
	-- on it that nothing can read.
	"WarriorKitLootFeed",
	"WarriorKitCombatFeed",
	"WarriorKitTooltip",
	"WarriorKitTooltipScan",
	-- the mail window, and the column of favourites down its left. Both named
	-- for the reason the chat window and its room rail are: a window that has
	-- wandered off the screen has to be findable from a macro, and
	-- scripts/harness.lua has to measure what was drawn without Mail/Window.lua
	-- handing out a reference to its own row pool.
	"WarriorKitMail",
	"WarriorKitMailFavourites",
	-- the quest log, and the column of quests down its left. Both named for the
	-- reason the mail window and its favourites column are, and the column for
	-- one more: a log grouped into zones lays sixty rows out from a model, and a
	-- column that has laid them out wrongly has to be measurable from a macro
	-- and from scripts/harness.lua without Quests/Window.lua handing out a
	-- reference to its own pool.
	"WarriorKitQuests",
	"WarriorKitQuestList",
	-- This addon's own quest tracker, the column of the zone you are standing
	-- in drawn over the world. Named for the reason every placeable frame here
	-- is: a frame with no chrome that has landed off the edge of the monitor is
	-- findable from a macro by its name and by nothing else, and the harness
	-- measures its rows through the same name.
	"WarriorKitQuestColumn",
	-- The two scrolling columns beside that list. Named for the same reason and
	-- for one more: the three of them share the window's width between four
	-- equal margins, and that arithmetic is only checkable from outside if each
	-- column can be found and measured.
	"WarriorKitQuestText",
	"WarriorKitQuestRewards",
	-- The other side of the tab over the middle column, and the zone drawn
	-- inside it. Both named for the reason the columns are, and the board for
	-- one more: what it draws is twelve tiles of somebody else's art cropped to
	-- the shape of a zone, and a map with a seam of black through it is only
	-- findable from outside if the tiles can be walked one texture coordinate at
	-- a time.
	"WarriorKitQuestMap",
	"WarriorKitQuestChart",
	-- The world map, and the zone drawn inside it. Both named for the reason the
	-- quest log and its board are: a window that has wandered off the screen has
	-- to be findable from a macro, and a picture carrying two hundred and fifty
	-- of another addon's icons has to be measurable from scripts/harness.lua
	-- without Map/Window.lua handing out a reference to the chart's own pools.

	"ReloadUI",
	-- the client's own menu, and the call that takes a frame off its panel
	-- stack. Core/Menu.lua adds one button to the first and closes it with
	-- the second, and both are probed before they are touched: neither is

	"GameMenuFrame", "HideUIPanel",

	-- reads it per message rather than once, so a lane survives a resolution
	-- change without being told about one. UIParent:GetWidth() answers the
	-- same number on a client and nothing at all under the harness stub.
	"GetScreenWidth",
	-- And the height in the same units, which on its own is 768 on every client
	-- and says nothing. It is read beside the width above, in UI/Pixel.lua, and
	-- the pair is what the aspect ratio is: both are in UIParent's units, so the
	-- scale divides out of the ratio and what is left is the shape of the
	-- monitor. That is how a window the size of the screen works out how wide the
	-- screen is without a second resolution CVar to parse.
	"GetScreenHeight",
	-- the four totem slots, read by Standing/Standing.lua. Probed by name
	-- rather than called outright, because nothing installed on this disk
	-- calls it and the client's own documentation marks it as a call that may
	-- return nothing at all.
	"GetTotemInfo",
	"UnitPlayerOrPetInParty", "UnitPlayerOrPetInRaid", "UnitIsPlayer",
	"C_NamePlate", "C_Spell",
	-- the pixel grid in UI/Pixel.lua. GetPhysicalScreenSize is the only honest

	-- for the same reason the rest of this block is: nothing installed here
	-- proves it exists on 2.5.6, and a square that loses it loses two rungs of
	-- the ladder rather than the bar.
	"GetMacroSpell",
	-- which frame the client says the cursor is over, read by Buttons/Trace.lua
	-- and by nothing else. Probed by name at every call: this is the one API in
	-- the addon whose only job is to answer a question about a bug, and a
	-- diagnostic that raises on a client without it would be a diagnostic that
	-- makes things worse.
	"GetMouseFocus", "GetMouseFoci",
	-- Where the pointer is, in physical pixels. Read by UI/Tooltip.lua and by
	-- nothing else, for the one box in the addon with no owner frame to hang
	-- off: a creature in the world. Nothing in this install is here to prove the
	-- call, so it is probed by name at its call site the way the two above are,
	-- and a client without it puts the box in the middle of the screen rather
	-- than not putting one up. It is an entry here because the probe is the
	-- shim and it lives beside the caller.
	"GetCursorPosition",
	-- what one action slot is doing, read by Buttons/Slot.lua on the bar's
	-- ticker. Probed by name in Slot.CanRead for the same reason the writers
	-- above are: nothing installed here proves any of them is on 2.5.6, and a

	"HasAction", "GetActionTexture", "GetActionCooldown", "GetActionCount",

	-- with the loose name beside it; Slot.CanRead probes both and resolves
	-- whichever answers to a local, and a client with neither keeps the bar.

	-- way, so a macro square is asked about the spell it would cast.
	"C_ActionBar", "IsHarmfulAction", "IsHarmfulSpell",

	-- and counts. Nothing in this install calls the two flag readers unguarded
	-- and OPie calls UnitFactionGroup, so all three are probed by name in

	-- unflagged, which is a missing bar rather than an error on the ticker.
	"UnitIsPVP", "UnitIsPVPFreeForAll", "UnitFactionGroup",

	-- for a table and Describe says so when the master switch is on and the
	-- table is not there, which is what would witness the name being wrong.
	"CombatTextTypeInfo",
	"GetGameTime",
	-- Looting, for the Comfort part. Leatrix Plus is loaded on both of these
	-- clients and calls all five unguarded inside its own faster-looting
	-- feature, which is the same feature and so the same proof;
	-- GetLootThreshold is also called unguarded by TitanLootType on both.
	-- GetLootMethod is the one that is not here: C_PartyInfo carries it on one
	-- client and the loose global on the other, so Comfort/Loot.lua probes for
	-- both and treats neither answering as "do not know" rather than "no".
	"IsModifiedClick", "GetNumLootItems", "GetLootSlotInfo", "LootSlot",
	"GetLootThreshold",
	-- The merchant, for the same part. MerchantFrame is read to prove the
	-- window is still up before anything is sold, because the container call
	-- behind it uses the item instead when it is not. Leatrix calls the frame
	-- and GetCoinText unguarded, Auctionator calls GetCoinText, and GetMoney is
	-- called unguarded by TitanGold, TitanRepair and Titan itself. The two
	-- ERR_ constants are reached through _G rather than named, because a client
	-- missing one would compare a message against nil and stop a sale that was
	-- fine.
	"MerchantFrame", "GetMoney", "GetCoinText",
	-- The mouse pointer, for the sell cursor over a bag square while a merchant
	-- is open. Baganator calls both unguarded on this client, ResetCursor on
	-- every item button's OnLeave and SetCursor on a category header at a
	-- vendor, and Questie and OPie call SetCursor unguarded as well. Bags/Grid.lua
	-- asks for BUY_CURSOR by name because that is what Blizzard's own bag button
	-- asks for; a client that does not know the name leaves the arrow alone and
	-- breaks nothing.
	"SetCursor", "ResetCursor",
	-- The mailbox is deliberately absent, all of it. Every call the Mail part
	-- makes moves somebody's property, so every one of them is reached through
	-- _G and probed at its own call site rather than named here: SendMail,
	-- SetSendMailMoney, SetSendMailShowing, GetSendMailItem, GetSendMailPrice,
	-- GetInboxNumItems, GetInboxHeaderInfo, GetInboxItem, GetInboxText,
	-- AutoLootMailItem, DeleteInboxItem, ReturnInboxItem, CloseMail,
	-- ATTACHMENTS_MAX_SEND, MailFrame and the friends list either side of
	-- C_FriendList. Baganator and Syndicator prove the attach path on this
	-- client and Mail/Send.lua cites them; proving a call exists is still not
	-- the same as proving it is safe to make unguarded.
	-- Repairing, for the same window. TitanRepair and Leatrix Plus are both
	-- installed on both of these clients and both call all four unguarded,
	-- inside their own auto-repair feature, which is the same feature and so
	-- the same proof. The guild bank trio is deliberately absent:
	-- CanGuildBankRepair, GetGuildBankMoney and GetGuildBankWithdrawMoney are
	-- only proven by TitanRepair calling them, and Classic Era has no guild
	-- bank at all, so Comfort/Repair.lua reaches all three through _G and
	-- pcalls them. A client without them loses guild funding and keeps the
	-- repair, which is the right way round to be wrong.
	"CanMerchantRepair", "GetRepairAllCost", "RepairAllItems",
	"GetInventoryItemDurability",
	-- The quest log, for the clutter scan and for the Quests part. Questie calls
	-- both of these unguarded on both clients and reads the quest id out of the
	-- eighth value exactly as Clutter.lua and Quests/Client.lua do.
	-- IsQuestFlaggedCompleted is not here: it lives on the loose global on one
	-- client and under C_QuestLog on the other, so it is resolved through _G the
	-- way Questie resolves it.
	--
	-- Every other quest log call the addon makes is deliberately absent, all
	-- eighteen of them. Questie proves some and not others, the two clients
	-- genuinely differ on the rest, and three of them move somebody's quest, so
	-- Quests/Client.lua reaches the lot through _G and probes each at its own
	-- call site: SelectQuestLogEntry, GetQuestLogSelection, ExpandQuestHeader,
	-- GetQuestLogIndexByID, GetQuestLogQuestText, GetNumQuestLeaderBoards,
	-- GetQuestLogLeaderBoard, GetQuestLogTimeLeft, the six reward calls,
	-- GetQuestLogItemLink, GetQuestLogRequiredMoney, IsQuestWatched, the watch
	-- pair, GetQuestLogPushable, QuestLogPushQuest, the abandon pair and
	-- ToggleQuestLog. GetQuestLogRewardXP is not a client call at all on either
	-- of these builds; Questie's own LibQuestXP writes that global, so absent is
	-- the normal answer rather than a failure.
	"GetNumQuestLogEntries", "GetQuestLogTitle",
	-- QuestieLoader, PickupContainerItem's loose fallback and DeleteCursorItem
	-- are deliberately absent. Questie is another addon and may not be
	-- installed; the container call goes through C_Container in Core; and
	-- nothing here calls DeleteCursorItem, Questie only hooks it, which proves
	-- the global exists and is not the same as proving the call is ours to make.
	-- All three are probed and pcalled in Core: ns.Questie is the one door on
	-- QuestieLoader and scripts/check.sh refuses a second.
	-- profiling, read by the Perf part. Every one of these is called unguarded
	-- by an addon in this install: debugprofilestop by Details, Questie and
	-- Auctionator, the memory pair by Details, TitanPerformance and Leatrix,
	-- the CPU pair and GetFramerate by Details and TitanPerformance. The CPU
	-- pair is read only where someone else has already turned scriptProfile on.
	"debugprofilestop", "GetFramerate",
	"UpdateAddOnMemoryUsage", "GetAddOnMemoryUsage",
	"UpdateAddOnCPUUsage", "GetAddOnCPUUsage",
	-- The other half of the profiler, read by the frame trace. No addon in this
	-- install calls any of these, so the evidence is the client itself: all four
	-- names are in WowClassic.exe's own symbol list on 2.5.6, which is what
	-- proves a call exists rather than what somebody else got away with. Every
	-- one is still type-checked and pcalled at the point of use, because a name
	-- in the binary says the call is there and says nothing about what it
	-- answers with scriptProfile off.
	"GetScriptCPUUsage", "GetNetStats",
	"GetNumAddOns", "GetAddOnInfo",
	"RAID_CLASS_COLORS", "wipe", "InCombatLockdown",
	-- the wall clock, for the time of day a feed row landed. GetTime counts
	-- from when the client started and is the right thing to record on; `time`
	-- is what turns that into a clock a person reads, and the pair of them is
	-- how Feeds/Loot.lua says when something dropped without keeping a formatted
	-- string on every entry. Both are called unguarded by TitanClock and by
	-- Details on both clients.
	"date", "time", "GetBuildInfo",
	-- Edit Mode. Titan calls EditModeManagerFrame:GetActiveLayoutInfo()
	-- unguarded, which is what proves the frame is here. The methods the
	-- EditMode part uses past that one are probed by name before every call.
	"EditModeManagerFrame", "Enum",
	-- Post-hooked onto a unit frame's own AnchorSelectionFrame, so Edit Mode's
	-- selection lands on the block rather than on the rectangle the frame used
	-- to be. Type-checked before it is called, like every other method the
	-- skin borrows from a client it cannot be sure of.
