--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What the fight is doing to you, in numbers
--
-- Every blow you land on something falls away from a point beside your left
-- shoulder, every blow an enemy lands on you falls away from one on your right,
-- and healing rises off your character. Damage is white, healing is green, and
-- a hit the game itself calls more than a hit is gold.
--
-- **Where the split comes from.** Damage is placed by who it happened to and
-- not by who caused it, which is the one rule that makes two columns readable
-- at a glance: everything on the left is the target's health going down,
-- everything on the right is an enemy taking yours. Healing is neither and gets
-- a third stream of its own.
--
-- The two columns are named `dealt` and `taken` rather than by a side. What is
-- read most is what you are doing, and what is read most goes where a
-- left-to-right reader looks first, so dealt is the left one; but that is a
-- placing and a placing is a setting, so the anchors could not be called left
-- and right without every identifier here going stale the first time somebody
-- dragged one across the screen.
--
-- **The right hand column is what the fight is doing to you and nothing else.**
-- A heal shipped there, on the argument that health going up and health going
-- down are both your own bar moving. On a screen that argument is worth
-- nothing: the right hand side is read as a threat, out of the corner of an
-- eye, and a green number in it is the one thing there that is good news. It
-- rises over your character instead, in a straight line, whoever cast it and
-- whoever it landed on.
--
-- **Only your own end of it.** The log names every creature in range and a
-- reader that drew all of it would be four other people's numbers over your
-- screen. Something you or yours did, or something done to you, and nothing
-- else. ns.Unit.Roster.Owner is the same door Feeds/Combat.lua asks that
-- through, so a pet, an imp and a totem are covered without this file knowing
-- what any of them are.
--
-- **The same blow twice is one number.** A bleed ticking four times in six
-- seconds used to be four numbers stacked on each other, each unreadable
-- because of the next. They merge instead: the number already in the air takes
-- the new amount, swells, and keeps its place in its own fall. That is the
-- single biggest thing that makes a stream of numbers readable, and it is the
-- reason this is built on a pool of items rather than on tweens, because a
-- tween owns its clock and a number merged into has to keep the clock it has.
--
-- **A big hit is drawn bigger.** A forty and a nine hundred at the same size
-- throw away the one thing you can read without looking. Every number is scaled
-- against the biggest one of the fight so far, which resets when you leave
-- combat so that the last pull's boss does not flatten the next one's trash.
--
-- **Which way a number bows is the column's and not the number's.** The stream
-- alternates when nobody says, and alternating is what two columns must not do:
-- half of what you land bows towards the middle of the screen and half away, so
-- the two sides read as leaning into each other over your character. Each column
-- leans one way now, outwards, and healing does not bow at all.
--
-- **A blow that does not land says so.** A dodge, a parry, a resist and a miss
-- are the client's own word for it in grey, in the column the blow was aimed
-- at, at the size of the smallest hit of the fight. Four dodges in a row is why
-- a rotation stalled. The quiet setting takes the client's own "Miss" off your
-- target along with its numbers, so while this part skipped them nothing on the
-- screen said a swing had failed. A word never merges: two parries are two
-- events, and one word that grew would read as neither.
--
-- Nothing here decides where the numbers come from. That is four rectangles in
-- CombatText/Anchors.lua that you drag.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The four colours, and they are the whole readout at a glance.
--
-- Held as tables this file owns rather than read off UI.Color, for the reason
-- Feeds/Combat.lua holds its own: these are the meaning of a number over the
-- world and not the palette of a panel, and the guard below compares a colour
-- by identity. The green, the gold and the grey are the same three values the
-- combat feed draws a heal, a critical and a miss in, because one fact must not
-- have two colours.
local DAMAGE = { 0.95, 0.95, 0.97 }
local HEAL = { 0.34, 0.80, 0.44 }
local BIG = { 1.00, 0.82, 0.20 }
local MISS = { 0.50, 0.50, 0.55 }

-- How far into its life a number may be and still be merged into. Past the
-- hold it is already fading and the eye has finished with it, so adding to one
-- reads as a number changing its mind rather than as one blow.
local MERGE_BEFORE = 0.45

-- What a number is scaled by, between the smallest hit of the fight and the
-- biggest. A narrow band on purpose, and it was too wide the first time: at
-- 0.78 to 1.20 an ordinary hit late in a fight was drawn at four fifths of a
-- setting that was itself too small, and the two shrinkings compounded into a
-- number you had to go looking for. The band says which of two numbers was the
-- bigger hit and that is all it is for; the setting says how big numbers are.
local FLOOR, REACH = 0.88, 0.30

-- Every number in this part is drawn in one font object and the size on the
-- settings page is a multiplier on top of it.
--
-- That is the opposite of the obvious design, which is a font object per size,
-- and it is better for two reasons. The stream already scales every frame it
-- carries, so a size setting expressed as a scale costs nothing at all beyond
-- what a number was going to pay anyway; and a font rebuilt when a slider moves
-- is a CreateFont per step of the drag, which the client never collects.
--
-- The face was UI.OutlineFloor, which is fourteen, and that was the bug behind
-- two rounds of "the numbers are too small". They were not small. A glyph
-- rasterised at fourteen pixels and then blown up to sixty by the frame's scale
-- is a fourteen pixel picture of a digit stretched over sixty pixels, and the
-- rim the outline buys is stretched with it. Nothing about it is legible at
-- speed and nothing about it gets better by asking for a larger multiplier,
-- which is what the last two attempts did.
--
-- Thirty-two is the face now, so the shipped size magnifies it by about two
-- rather than by five, and the outline lands at about the weight a native
-- thirty-two pixel outlined glyph has. It has to be a literal at file scope:
-- scripts/check.sh reads the size out of every UI.Label that asks for a rim and
-- fails a call whose size it cannot follow, which is the gate that keeps an
-- outline off text too small to carry one. Well above the floor either way.
local FACE = 32

-- Where the numbers are on a line, read from the one place that knows. The two
-- other readers of the combat log still hold copies of this table and the note
-- beside it in Core/CombatLog.lua says why they are a separate commit.
local SHAPES = ns.CombatLog.SHAPES

-- Whether a GUID is you or something of yours, which is the whole of the filter
-- that keeps four other people's numbers off your screen.
local Mine = ns.Unit.Roster.Mine

-- Which way each stream bows out of its fall, handed to Stream.Push per number.
--
-- Outwards, so the two damage columns open away from your character rather than
-- across it. Healing is a straight rise and asks for no side at all, which is
-- the zero: the heal styles carry no arc, so the value is a statement rather
-- than a setting, and it is here rather than nowhere so that the table answers
-- for every stream this file throws.
