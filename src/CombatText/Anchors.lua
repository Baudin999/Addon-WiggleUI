-- The four places numbers come from
--
-- Everything this part draws flies away from one of four points on the screen,
-- and every one of them is a rectangle you can unlock and drag. What you land
-- on your target comes off the left one, what an enemy lands on you comes off
-- the right one, healing rises off the one over your character, and a word
-- about the fight comes off the one above your head.
--
-- **They are named for the blow and not for the side.** `dealt` and `taken`
-- say which half of the fight a number belongs to; where each one sits is a
-- pair of numbers in the saved variables and the player may drag them anywhere,
-- including across each other. Ids called `mine` and `theirs` shipped once and
-- were worse than useless: `mine` meant blows landing on me, which reads as
-- blows I dealt to everybody who ever had to change this file, and it was on
-- the wrong side of the screen for the whole of its life without a single
-- identifier looking wrong.
--
-- **Healing is a stream of its own and not a column of damage.** It went out
-- with what lands on you, on the argument that both are your own health bar
-- moving. That argument is wrong on a screen: the right hand column is what the
-- fight is doing to you, it is read as a threat, and a heal is the one thing
-- there that is not. So it is its own anchor over the character, it rises, and
-- the right hand side is enemies alone.
--
-- **Why the spawn point is the whole anchor.** A number's flight has two ends
-- and only the first one is placed. Where it finishes is the start plus the
-- fall, and the fall is a number on the settings page, so moving the anchor
-- moves the whole arc rather than stretching it. The alternative is eight grab
-- handles for four streams, which is a placing session rather than a setting,
-- and it cannot express the curve anyway: the far end of a bow is not a
-- straight offset from the near one.
--
-- **Why they are frames at all rather than a pair of numbers each.** A number
-- is anchored CENTER to CENTER on one of these, so the anchor is what the flight
-- is measured against and it survives a resolution change, a UI scale change and
-- a drag without any of the three being handled here. UI/Placeable.lua already
-- owns the drag, the rim, the name over it and writing the corner back into a
-- setting, and this file is twelve lines of caller on top of it.
--
-- The rectangles have nothing in them and take the mouse only while they are
-- unlocked, which is the case UI/Placeable.lua's `name` option exists for: they
-- sit over the middle of the screen where the right button drag that turns the
-- camera starts, and a frame that answered the mouse all the time would eat it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Big enough to grab and read a name over, and no larger: this is a handle
-- rather than a container. Nothing is ever parented into one, so its size has

-- because twelve parts wrote the same drag out longhand.
