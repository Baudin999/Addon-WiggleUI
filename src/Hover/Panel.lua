--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The part's page in the options window, and nothing else.
--
-- Its own file for the reason UnitFrames/Panel.lua is one: everything here
-- reads a setting, draws a control and writes it back, and nothing here decides
-- anything. What is left in Feature.lua is the part's contract with Core.
--
-- The page is a list of rows and one empty row at the top of it. A row is a
-- whole binding: the spell, the key, who it lands on, and the cross that takes
-- it off. Fill the empty row and it becomes a bound one and a new empty row is
-- under your cursor again.
--
-- It was three stacked controls and a read-only list underneath, which is the
-- shape a settings page falls into when each control is added on its own. It
-- asked for the three decisions in a fixed order, in three different places on
-- the page, and once a binding was made the only thing you could do to it was
-- delete it and start again. Every one of those is the same defect: the thing
-- being edited is a row and the page was not drawing rows.
--
-- So the row is the widget and the empty one is the same widget with a draft
-- behind it rather than a saved binding. Nothing on the page has an order you
-- have to follow, changing your mind about any one column costs one click, and
-- what is bound is where you would reach for it, which is on the binding.

-- The row's own geometry, and the only numbers in this file. The key box is
-- sized for CTRL-SHIFT-BUTTON4 and the target button for "an enemy"; the name
-- takes whatever is left, because it is the one column that can be trimmed with
-- an ellipsis and still say which spell it is.
local SQUARE, KEY_W, WHO_W = M.control, 118, 76

-- What the slot will take off the cursor, handed to the widget layer, which
-- knows what a square is and nothing about a spell.
--
-- A refusal is said once per reason rather than once per ask. The widget puts
-- the same question to this on the way in as it does on a drop, so a cursor
-- carrying something the slot will not take passes through here every time the
-- mouse crosses the square, and a line per pass fills the chat frame with one
-- sentence. Keyed by the sentence itself, the way Buttons/Square.lua keys its
-- own, so a second thing going wrong still gets said.
