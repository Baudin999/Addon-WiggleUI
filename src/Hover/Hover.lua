-- Casting on what the mouse is over
--
-- One key, one spell, and the mob or the party member under the cursor. It is
-- what Clique does and it is why Clique is installed on nearly every healer in
-- the game, and this is the addon's own so the bindings live beside every other
-- setting rather than in a second addon's saved variables.
--
-- The mechanism is already proven here. Marking/Keys.lua binds modified mouse
-- buttons through SetOverrideBindingClick and marks `mouseover`, out in the
-- world and on a nameplate both, and the whole of the reasoning for that is in
-- its header. The one thing marking did not need is the one thing this needs:
-- casting is protected, so the click has to land on a secure button out of
-- UI/Press.lua rather than on a plain button running Lua.
--
-- This file is the model and nothing else. What a binding is, what the cursor is
-- carrying, which key is free, and what macro one binding turns into. Cast.lua
-- owns the button and the keys, Sheet.lua draws the list on screen, and neither
-- of them decides anything.
--
-- The filter is a macro conditional and the whole macro is built here, because
-- it is the whole of what a binding means. Cast.lua puts it on the button as
-- macro text, the way Charge/Icon.lua has always put its own, and the argument
-- for that being text and not attributes is in Cast.lua's header.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Twelve, which is a full action bar's worth of keys and more than anybody
-- holds in their hands at once. The ceiling exists because the sheet and the
-- panel both build their rows once and show the ones that are used:
-- a row that appears when you bind a key has to already be there.
local MAX = 12

Hover.MAX = MAX

-- Who a press is allowed to land on, and the macro conditional that says so.
--
-- `nodead` is on all three. A dead mouseover is a corpse you are looting or a
-- party member waiting on a resurrection, and a heal or a Rend aimed at one is
-- a press that reports an error back at you for nothing.
--
-- The order is the order the picker offers them in and the order the sheet
-- sorts by, so enemy first: this addon's own class is a warrior and the enemy
-- binding is the one that gets made first.
--
-- `clause` is the filter as the conditional the press is made under, and
-- `unless` is its negation, one clause per term, which is what sends the press
-- through to whatever the key did before when the thing under the cursor is
-- not `label`. Written out rather than derived, because the negation of two
-- terms is two clauses and deriving that from a string is a parser for three
-- rows.

-- What is on the cursor
--
-- The slot in the options page is filled by dropping a spell on it, which means
-- reading GetCursorInfo, which is the one call in this file that cannot be
-- written from the documentation with any confidence.
--
-- For an item it answers the kind, the id and the link, and UI/Widgets.lua has
-- been reading it that way since the first page took a drop. For a spell it
-- answers the spellbook index and which book it is in, and newer builds put the
-- spell id in a fourth slot. Nothing installed on this machine proves which of
-- those 2.5.6 hands back, so all three readings are tried and the first one that
-- names a spell wins. A select(4) written straight would be right on one client
-- and silently nil on the other.
--
-- A wrong reading is visible before it costs anything. The name and the icon go
-- into the slot, and the key is not pressed until you have looked at them.

-- What one binding casts
--
-- Built here rather than in Cast.lua, because it is the whole of what a binding
-- means and none of it is about a button or a key. Cast.lua puts the text on
-- the button and `/wk hover show` reads it back off.
--
-- Two lines. The spell on the thing under the cursor when the filter passes,
-- and when it does not, a click on whatever the key was pressing before this
-- binding was put on top of it: the square on the bar, for the key a heal is
-- already on. That is what makes one key a heal on the party member under the
-- cursor and a heal on yourself with nothing there, and it is the whole of what
-- a key on both a bar and this list means.
--
-- `beneath` is that button, or nil for a key that pressed nothing, in which
-- case the press with nothing under the cursor does nothing. A key that quietly
-- hits your target when you meant to hover something is worse than a key that
-- does nothing, and the sheet has no way to draw the difference.
--
-- `@mouseover` once. Charge/Icon.lua has run that spelling on this client since
-- it shipped, so the `target=mouseover` this used to be doubled with was a
-- hedge against a build this addon does not run on.
