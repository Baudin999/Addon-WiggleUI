-- Three lists, and the split is what makes the page usable rather than

-- the two halves anybody thinks in, and each fit without scrolling
-- until the thirteenth window: a list is fifteen cells at most with
-- its reading and its button under it, and the spell book was the

-- Blizzard page already splits them: the ones that stand in for a
-- window of the client's, and the ones the client has no copy of.
--
-- The sentence under every row is gone with it. It said which stop that
-- screen was on and whether the stop kept a hairline sharp, twenty three
-- times, and the reading at the foot of each list answers that for every
-- row at once: the stops that stay exact are a fact about the monitor,
-- not about the screen being sized.

-- Fourteen of them is fifteen cells with the reading and the button
-- under them, which is the wall the windows hit, and the fourteenth
-- arrived with the floating numbers. So they are two lists as well, and
-- the line between them is the one a player already has in their head:
-- what a pull puts on the screen, and what was there before it.
--

-- registration: `window` says it is a window at all, `own` that the
-- client has no copy of it, and `fight` that a screen drawn over the
