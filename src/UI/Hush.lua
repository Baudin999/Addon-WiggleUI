-- Where the HUD goes while a screen window is up
--
-- A screen window is half the monitor of type with no ground under it, read
-- against whatever the player happens to be standing on. Every rectangle this
-- addon draws over the world is a rectangle that can land in the middle of it:
-- the missing buff row, the racial nag, the cooldowns, the swing bars, the
-- meters, the two feeds, the standing row and the three unit blocks. The sheet
-- is the one thing on screen you opened on purpose and it was the only thing
-- with anything drawn on top of it.
--
-- **Only what is actually under it.** This used to be one switch: a sheet up
-- meant every registered part away, wherever it sat. That is right for the
-- three rows the sheet lands on and wrong for the rest, and the rest is most of
-- them, because a sheet pinned to one edge of the monitor leaves the other edge
-- alone. You lost your swing timer to a sheet that was nowhere near it. So the
-- answer is per part and it is a rectangle test: a part hides when it overlaps
-- a window that has asked, and comes back the moment it does not. Partly
-- covered counts. A row with one corner under the sheet is a row you cannot
-- read, and the alternative is arguing about how much of a number has to be
-- missing before it stops being a number.
--
-- **Which means it is asked again, not answered once.** The picture moves for
-- more reasons than the sheet opening. Buffs/Nag.lua sets the missing buff row's
-- width from how many buffs are missing on every paint, Cooldowns/Row.lua sets
-- both of the cooldown row's from how many cooldowns are up, and the meters and
-- the rails do the same; the sheet itself is dragged, and it re-places itself
-- out of every rescale. Hooking each of those is six hooks and a seventh
-- somebody forgets next month. So the sweep below runs off a tick while a
-- window is up, and off nothing at all while none is.
--
-- **The frames stand down rather than being argued with.** Core/Attic.lua makes
-- the same move on the client's frames and its header carries the reasoning:
-- visibility in this client is a property of the parent chain, so a frame whose
-- parent is hidden is not drawn whatever anybody calls on the frame itself.
-- Every row here is driven by a ticker or an event that shows and hides it as
-- the fight goes, and a Hide called from this file would be undone on the next
-- tick. A hidden parent is not. One parent per part rather than one for all of
-- them, which is the whole of what the rectangle test needed underneath it.
--
-- **The row's own answer is untouched.** IsShown on a child of a hidden frame
-- still reads back what its owner last wrote, so the nag goes on deciding it
-- has three squares to draw, /wui status goes on saying so, and the row is
-- exactly as it was the moment the sheet comes off it. Nothing here has to be
-- told what any of these frames are for.
--
-- **The ticker keeps running.** OnUpdate stops on a frame that is not visible
-- and OnEvent does not, and every row in this addon puts its tick on a separate
-- event frame rather than on the rectangle, which Buffs/Nag.lua's own header
-- gives the reason for. That is load bearing twice over now: a row that stopped
-- resizing while it was covered would be measured at the size it had when it
-- went away, and would never come back at the size that clears the sheet.
--
-- **A cell is UIParent's size and shape.** These frames are anchored to
-- UIParent by the point UI/Placeable.lua wrote for them, so nothing about
-- where they sit depends on the cell at all. It matches anyway, because the one
-- that is not placed yet takes its default point from its parent and the answer
-- has to be the same either way. Scale is already independent: UI/Pixel.lua's
-- Adopt sets SetIgnoreParentScale on every frame that arrives, which is exactly
-- why the test below multiplies every corner back up by the frame's own scale
-- before comparing two of them.
--
-- **Nothing secure comes into a cell.** Reparenting is one of the calls the
-- client refuses an addon mid fight on a protected frame, and the sheet is
-- opened in a fight by a snippet. The action bars, the unit frames and the gear
-- squares are all protected. What a cell holds is a rectangle the addon draws
-- for itself, and it is only ever hidden and shown, which the client does not
-- care about on a frame with nothing protected inside it.
--
-- **The unit frames stand down by snippet instead.** Each one is an anchor of
-- ours with a secure unit button inside it, so it cannot be reparented and it
-- cannot be hidden from Lua in a fight, which is the fight the sheet is most
-- often opened in. They register through UI.HushableSecure below and a snippet
-- on the guard hides them, which is the sanctioned way an addon does a
-- protected thing in combat and the same way UI/Placeable.lua moves the sheet
-- itself. The anchor is what the snippet hides and never the button: the button
-- is driven by the client's own unit watch, and a hidden parent leaves that
-- answer alone the way it leaves a row's own flag alone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How often the picture is read again while a window is up. A tenth of a
-- second is a row that trails the sheet's edge by at most that much on a drag,
-- and four corners off ten frames a second is a cost nothing on the performance
-- tab can separate from zero.
local INTERVAL = 0.1

local guard, pulse

-- Who has asked for quiet, keyed by the frame that asked.
--
-- A set rather than a count. A counter drifts the first time a show is paired
-- with two hides or a window comes up twice without going down, and what it
-- drifts into is a HUD that never comes back, which is a bug the player has no
-- way to read. A set can be written the same way twice and still be right.
--
-- It is also the list of rectangles a part is tested against: the key is the
-- window's own frame, so where the window is is read off it every sweep and a
-- sheet being dragged needs nothing said to this file.
local asked = {}

-- Every part that gets out from under a window, in the order it registered.
--
-- One list and not two, because the question asked of each is the same question
-- and only the delivery differs: a plain part is parented into a cell this file
-- hides, a part holding something protected keeps its parent and a snippet
-- hides it. `over` is the answer last written and it is what makes a sweep that
-- finds nothing moved cost four reads and no writes.
local parts = {}

-- How many of those went to the guard, which is the number the snippet counts
-- through, and how many times it has been told to act. The turn exists because
-- the client drops a SetAttribute that writes the value the attribute already
-- holds: a snippet hung off a flag would sit still on the one write that has to
-- land, which is a block registering while the sheet is already up.
local secured, turns = 0, 0

-- Hide them, or give them back, from inside the restricted environment.
--
-- A flag per frame rather than one for all of them, because the sheet covers
-- the player block and the target block at different moments and covers target
-- of target on neither. Read off the guard rather than passed in: the value
-- that arrives with the turn is the turn. Frame refs are the only handles a
-- snippet has, so the registration below writes one per frame under a name this
-- can count through.

-- takes every frame it adopts off its parent's scale and writes its own, so a
