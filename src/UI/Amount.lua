-- How many
--
-- One number, picked before something happens to that many of a thing. Buying
-- five stacks of water off a vendor is the first of them; splitting a pile in
-- your bags is the same window with a different sentence under the number, and
-- so is every trade, mail and bank move after that. So it is one window rather
-- than one per site, for the reason UI/Ask.lua is one window: the question has
-- the same shape everywhere it is asked.
--
-- **It is not UI.Ask with a number bolted on.** A question is answered yes or
-- no and the window is a sentence. This is answered with a quantity, which
-- means the window has to say what each quantity comes to before you commit to
-- it: twenty water and two silver fifty is a different decision from four water
-- and fifty copper, and reading it off the number alone is arithmetic the
-- player should not be doing at a vendor. `note` is where the caller writes
-- that line, because what a count comes to is the caller's business and the
-- three ways to set the count are this file's.
--
-- **Three ways to set it, because three habits exist.** The two ends nudge by
-- one, the bar is dragged when the range is long enough that nudging is twenty
-- clicks, and the wheel works anywhere over the window because that is what a
-- wheel over a number does everywhere else. All three land in one place, which
-- is what keeps the readout, the bar and the sentence from disagreeing.
--
-- **The bar is optional and the window is not.** Slider is a frame type rather
-- than a template so it needs no Blizzard XML, but nothing installed on 2.5.6
-- proves it takes a thumb texture from a stranger, so it is probed exactly the
-- way UI/Scroll.lua probes it. Refused, the window loses the drag and keeps the
-- two ends, the wheel and the readout, which is a worse window rather than a
-- broken one.
--
-- **One window, reused.** Every popup in this addon is built once and
-- repainted, for the reason UI/Widgets.lua's dropdown gives: this client cannot
-- destroy a frame, so a window made per question is a window leaked per
-- question. Two of these cannot be on the screen at once, which is the
-- behaviour you want from a window that spends money.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

local WIDTH = 236

-- The number this window is about, drawn bigger than anything else on it.
--
-- Its own size rather than M.heading, and the reason is what the window is for.
-- Everything else here is a label on the thing you are choosing; this is the
-- choice. It is read from across a stepper you are clicking rather than looked
-- at, and at body size it sat between two buttons and looked like a caption
-- rather than the answer.
local NUMBER = 18

-- The bar under the readout: the scrollbar's track, lying down, with a thumb
-- you can actually grab. Twelve wide rather than the scrollbar's twenty four
-- long, because a horizontal thumb that wide covers a fifth of the track on a
-- range of five.
local TRACK, THUMB = M.bar, 12

-- way.
