--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The feed
--
-- A column of things that happened, newest at the top, older below it, and the
-- older ones still there when you scroll down to look.
--
-- **Why this is not UI/Log.lua.** That file is a column of strings and the
-- client's own ScrollingMessageFrame draws it, which is exactly right for
-- conversation and cannot do this: a message frame holds text and nothing else,
-- so an icon per line is not something it can be asked for. A row here is an
-- icon, a name, a number and a coloured mark down its left edge, which is four
-- regions the client has no line type for.
--
-- **Why this is not UI/Stack.lua and UI/Scroll.lua.** Those lay a column out by
-- asking every row how tall it is and placing them one under the next, which
-- means a row arriving reflows the whole column. UI/Log.lua's header already
-- argues that case and refuses it, and a feed is the same argument again with a
-- worse constant: four hundred entries measured every time a mob drops
-- something.
--
-- **So the rows do not move.** There is one frame per visible row, built once,
-- anchored once, and never anchored again. What arrives is written into a ring
-- of entries, and scrolling is an offset into that ring: the rows keep their
-- positions and repaint from a different place in the list. Ten rows repaint
-- whether the feed holds ten entries or four hundred, so a scroll costs the
-- same as a drop and both cost ten guarded writes.
--
-- That also means there is no clipping to arrange, no canvas to move and no
-- ScrollFrame to probe. The rows exactly fill the space, so there is nothing
-- to clip.
--
-- **An arrival marks and a frame draws.** A feed changes when something happens
-- to you, which is an event, and it changes when you scroll it, which is a
-- gesture. Neither of those is a clock, and a row carries none: a relative
-- timestamp would be the one thing here that has to be redrawn while nothing is
-- happening, which is why the time lives in the tooltip.
--
-- What the tick is for is the other end of that. In a pull the combat log
-- arrives faster than the screen is drawn, so painting on the arrival painted
-- thirteen rows three or four times for one frame the player ever saw. Push
-- marks the feed instead and the tick paints whatever is marked, once, on the
-- frame that is about to be drawn. An idle feed costs one field read a frame,
-- and a feed nobody can see costs nothing at all: the tick hangs off the feed's
-- own frame, so the client stops calling it the moment the column is hidden.
--
-- A feed that has never been built has no frame and no tick, and nothing can
-- mark it. That is the shape on purpose: what is not there is not dirty.
--
-- **A row has three text columns and the middle one is optional.** A name and a
-- number were not enough for the combat log: "Overpower 321" and "Plains
-- Creeper 26" are the same shape and only one of them is a spell, so there was
-- no reading a row and knowing who had done what to whom. The middle column is
-- dim, right aligned against the number, and asked for by the caller in units,
-- so the loot feed keeps two columns and the combat feed gets three without
-- either being a special case in here. All three widths are decided per resize
-- rather than per row, which is why a run of numbers reads as a column.
--
-- **A marker is a break in the timeline, not an entry in it.** Feed:Mark pushes
-- one and it draws as a band across the whole row with a word on it: no icon,
-- no middle column, nothing a thing that happened to you can look like. Here
-- rather than faked in Feeds/Combat.lua because "one set of events ends and
-- another begins" is a thing any feed wants, and a marker built out of an
-- ordinary row is one an ordinary row can be mistaken for.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Every number is a unit, which is one physical pixel inside a frame
-- ns.UI.Adopt has taken onto the grid, and a whole block of them above zoom 1.
--
-- The icon is 27 for the reason Meter/Window.lua's is: the client stores a
-- spell or item icon at 64 texels, UI/Draw.lua's crop leaves 54 of them, and a
-- draw is one texel per pixel only at 54 and 27. Everything else on a row
-- follows from it.
-- What an icon is drawn at before anybody moves the slider, and the two units
-- of row it leaves round itself. The row is the icon plus the pad rather than a
-- number of its own, because the two were 29 and 27 and a slider that moved one
-- without the other would either crop the art or leave a gap that grew.
local ICON = 27
local ROW_PAD = 2
local ROW_GAP = 1
-- The strip over the rows. It was 16, which was a heading and nothing else in
-- it; a chip is a square you have to be able to hit with a mouse at a UI scale
-- of one half, and 16 left it no air at all.
local HEADER = 20
local RULE = 1
local INSET = 3     -- the stripe to the icon
local STRIPE = 2    -- the coloured mark down the left of a row
local GUTTER = 5    -- the icon to the name
local PAD = 4       -- one text column to the next

-- How small and how large a row's icon can be asked to go.
--
-- The floor is the text, not the art. It was ns.UI.OutlineFloor's: every string
-- on a row carried a rim, a rim wants 14 pixels of glyph under it, and a row
-- shorter than 16 was a row whose name did not fit in it however small the
-- picture got. The rim is gone and the wash under the row is what holds the
-- text off the world, so the floor is no longer a font's minimum; 16 stands
-- until somebody measures a shorter row with the wash actually under it. The
-- ceiling is one step past ns.UI.IconTexels halved, which is 27 and the one
-- size in this range that draws a stored texel per screen pixel; past 40 a feed
-- row is taller than the tooltip describing it.
--
-- Published rather than local because Feeds/Feature.lua puts the stepper on a
-- panel page and a second copy of the range is a second thing to keep in step.
UI.FEED_ICON, UI.FEED_ICON_LOW, UI.FEED_ICON_HIGH = ICON, 16, 40

-- One filter chip: a cell of a bar in the strip over the rows. Sixteen units
-- inside a twenty unit header, which is the same two units of air the heading
-- text gets.
local CHIP = 16
-- The mark inside a cell. It was fourteen, which put a gem against the hairline
-- of its own square; eleven leaves it two and a half units of bar on each side.
local CHIP_MARK = 11
-- The hollow square the reason chip draws. Even, so it centres on whole units
-- in a sixteen unit cell and its one pixel edge does not land between two.
local CHIP_RING = 10
-- The air between one bar and the next, and the only air on the strip. The
-- cells inside a bar are flush, so six units is enough to say two questions.
local CHIP_BREAK = 6
-- What the mark on a chip that is switched off is painted at. Not hidden and
-- not greyed: the colour and the shape are what say which chip it is, so an off
-- chip keeps both and loses its light. Low enough to read as off across the
-- room and high enough to still find with a cursor.
local CHIP_OFF = 0.25
-- The xmark, which is the letter scripts/bake-glyphs.sh put it on.
local CLEAR = "x"
-- The trash can, on a row beside the cross and on the delete list's control in
-- the strip. scripts/bake-glyphs.sh put it on `t` for the bag window's clear.
local TRASH = "t"
-- The delete list's control: the can, a count beside it and the inset round
-- both. Wide enough for a two digit count at the chips' mark size.
local LIST = 36

-- The number column, fixed rather than grown to fit. A string that sizes itself
-- puts every number at a different distance from the edge, which is a ragged
-- column of damage. Six glyphs at the row size, which is a five figure hit with
-- a crit mark on it.
--
-- 42 while the addon drew in Arial Narrow, whose digits are 0.456 em, so six of
-- them at fourteen pixels came to 38 and the column carried four spare. Noto
-- Sans is 0.572 and the same six come to 48, so the column is 52 and carries
-- the same four. A five figure crit was the string this was sized for and it is
-- the string that would have gone off the left edge of the row.
local AMOUNT = 52

-- Shadowed, every string in this file, and the wash under the row is why.
--
-- A feed looks like it is drawn on a surface, and it is not one this addon can
-- promise anything about: the background is a slider the player drags and it
-- goes to zero. Every string here was rimmed for that, and a rim is a patch for
-- having no ground. There is ground now, painted by the row itself, so the
-- glyph keeps the pixel of every stroke the rim was spending and takes a shadow
-- instead, which is what the character sheet draws in over the same world.
--
-- Both sizes stay at 14 and neither is a setting. The floor that used to hold
-- them there is gone with the rim, and 14 is still what a name and a five
-- figure number want in a 29 pixel row; a size a player could drag is a column
-- whose three text columns stop lining up with each other.

local HELD = 400

-- How far back Feed:Fold looks for the row an arrival belongs on.
--
-- Sixteen entries is a corpse and the two before it, which is the whole of what

-- it per arrival is four hundred comparisons on the path a pull drives, which
-- is the cost Feed:Window exists to avoid.
local LOOKBACK = 16

-- How often the box over a parked cursor is filled again.
--
-- With the mouse resting on the top row of a live feed the entry under it
-- changes on every arrival, and following that unthrottled is a Tip.Build, a
-- Scan.Read and a Tooltip.Layout per combat log line. Five times a second is
-- faster than anybody reads a tooltip and it is two orders of magnitude below
-- what a pull was asking for. What it costs is that the box can name the row
-- before last for a fifth of a second, which is a box you are still reading.
local REOPEN = 0.2

-- What the bottom row fades to when there is more underneath it.
--
-- The one piece of decoration in this file, and it is carrying information
-- rather than atmosphere: it is the difference between a feed that has stopped
-- and a feed that continues past the bottom edge. The scrollbar says the same
-- thing and says it in eight pixels off to the side, which is not where you are
-- looking. Written once per row per paint, behind a guard, and it costs nothing
-- because it is a function of the row's position rather than of the clock.

-- two are deliberately separate: they are allowed to pick different icon sizes,
-- and a shared function would be a shared decision.
--
-- The size is an argument now that it is a setting. It was this file's own

-- The filter strip
--
-- A run of small coloured squares along the top of the feed, one per kind of
-- thing the feed can hold, each of them on or off. It is the answer to a
-- question a settings page answers badly: "not right now" is a thing you decide
-- while looking at the feed, and a window you have to open, find a page in and
-- close again is a window you stop opening.
--
-- **A chip is a mark in a colour.** No word on it and no word beside it. The
-- five quality chips are one glyph, a gem, in the game's own quality ramp read
-- left to right, which is a thing every player in this game already reads
-- without being told; a word on each would be five words of English in a feed
-- whose rows are localised.
--
-- **A run of chips is one bar.** Two grounds were wrong before this one. The
-- first drew each chip as a rectangle of flat quality colour, and seven swatches
-- in a row was a colour picker left on the screen by mistake. The second gave
-- each chip its own dark square and hairline, the way an ability square is
-- drawn, and eight of those with a fourteen unit mark in each read as a row of
-- emoji: every square the same weight, every mark touching its edge, and the
-- break between the two runs lost among the gaps inside them. So a run is one
-- surface under one hairline, its cells are flush and its marks are bare. The
-- break between two bars is the only air on the strip, which makes it the one
-- thing the spacing says.
--
-- **The reason chip draws the ring.** It was the circle glyph, which at chip
-- size is a filled white disc and names nothing. What it switches is the hollow
-- square a row draws round its icon, so that square is its mark.
--
-- **The reset is up only while it would do something.** A cross after the last
-- bar turns every chip back on, and it is there while one of them is off. It
-- sits after the chips rather than before them, so its coming and going moves
-- nothing else on the strip.
--
-- **Off is a dim mark, not a gone one.** A chip that hid itself would leave a
-- strip whose chips move about as you click them, and a chip that went grey
-- would lose the one thing saying which one it is. The square and its hairline
-- never move and never change, so the strip keeps its rhythm; what goes out is
-- the coloured mark on top of it.
--
-- **The filter is what is drawn, not what is kept.** Nothing here refuses an
-- entry at the door. Everything that drops is recorded and the chips decide
-- what the column shows, which is why turning one back on brings its history
-- with it rather than starting an empty list.
--
-- The caller hands over one table per chip, in the order they are drawn:
--
--   { color = , mark = , tip = , get = function() end, set = function(on) end }
--   { color = , ring = true, tip = , get = , set = }   the hollow square
--   { gap = true }   air, for the break between one bar of chips and the next
--
-- On is the chip's resting state: the reset sets every chip back to it.
--
-- `mark` is the letter the glyph face draws its mark on. See
-- scripts/bake-glyphs.sh for which letter is which mark and why the letter
-- matters on a client that will not take the font.
--
-- `tip` is a string, or a function answering one for a chip whose sentence is
-- not knowable until somebody hovers it.

-- Whether the middle column is drawn on this row, which is a question about the

--
-- A note is drawn whole or it is not drawn. The column is a width and the note
-- is a measurement, and nothing here compared the two until this: a stream asks
-- for the room it believes its widest string wants, Resize hands back half of
-- what is left after the number at most, and a font string given less than its
-- string needs drops the end of it without saying so. Feeds/Combat.lua asks for
-- 96 units and "from Plains Creeper" measures 131 in the shipped face at a

-- been drawn at.
--
-- Measured rather than declared, and that is why the rule is here rather than a
-- shorter string in the two streams. `geom.note` is clamped to half the free
-- width in Resize, so the same string fits at one feed width and clips at the
-- next one down, and a number a stream wrote once cannot answer a question the
-- player moves.

-- feed with a ragged number column on it.

-- nobody is looking at, redrawing itself two hundred times a second, is the
-- clearest case of work nobody asked for in the addon.
