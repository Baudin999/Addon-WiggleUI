-- A frame you can unlock, drag, and find again next login
--
-- Twelve parts of this addon put a rectangle on the world that the player is
-- allowed to move, and until this file existed every one of them wrote the
-- same block to do it: SetMovable, SetClampedToScreen, a drag that refuses
-- while the frames are locked, a drag stop that reads the point back, rounds
-- the offsets and writes them into a setting, and a Lock that toggles
-- RegisterForDrag. Nine of them also drew a rim over the whole frame and a
-- name above it, because a frame with no chrome and nothing in it is a piece
-- of empty screen you would otherwise have to find from memory.
--
-- Nothing was wrong at any one site, which is exactly why it reached twelve.
-- It is the story the tooltip rule in scripts/check.sh was written for, a
-- second time, and the clone scan found two of the copies matching character
-- for character, comments and all: Cooldowns/Row.lua and Swing/Gauges.lua
-- carried the same note about a drag landing wherever the cursor was, with one
-- noun changed.
--
-- The split that let it happen was chrome. UI.Window owns the background, the
-- hairline, the title bar and the close box, and it owned a broken half of the
-- placing too: it made every window movable and then had nowhere to put the
-- result, so the one window that has to remember where it sits overwrote the
-- scripts UI.Window had just installed with a thirteenth copy of them. Chrome
-- is not the axis. Placing is one thing, chrome is another, six frames want
-- both, six want only the first, and UI.Window is a caller of this file rather
-- than a rival to it.
--
-- What this does not know is which setting it is writing. The caller passes a
-- function that takes the finished anchor, because this layer is not allowed
-- to know the name of a setting, which is the rule UI.Size and the tooltip's
-- dock are both already written to. Whether the frames are locked arrives the
-- same way, as the argument to Lock, so ns.db stays out of src/UI/ entirely.

-- Frames that have no chrome of their own get a rim and a name while they are

--
-- Mouse only while unlocked, because a mouse enabled frame swallows every
-- button that lands on it, including the right button drag that turns the
-- camera, and these sit over the middle of the screen where that drag starts.
-- A frame with chrome is the opposite case: it has controls in it, it answers
-- the mouse all the time, and it is grabbable by the bar across its top, so it
-- passes no name and this leaves its mouse alone.
--
-- The label is at the outline floor rather than at the panel's body size. It
-- is drawn over the world while the frame is being placed, so it has to carry
-- a rim, and a rim costs a pixel of every stroke: at 12 it was closing up its
-- own counters to buy an edge it could not do without.

-- The four attributes a secure drag writes, and the snippet that reads them.
--
-- The restricted environment does not carry StartMoving. It was written here as
-- though it did, and every drag on the character sheet ended in "attempt to call
-- a nil value" out of RestrictedExecution. What it does carry is SetPoint, and
-- that is enough: a frame the client refuses to let an addon move in combat is
-- one a snippet may still place, so a secure drag is a point written once a
-- frame rather than a move the client runs on our behalf.
--
-- A snippet cannot read a cursor, a scale or a Lua table, so the insecure half
-- does that arithmetic and hands the answer over as attributes. That is what
-- attributes are for: they are the way a value gets from insecure code into the
-- restricted environment, and the environment decides what may be done with it.
--
-- Four of them rather than one string, because this runs once a frame for as
-- long as the button is down and a string is a fresh object every time. Numbers
-- are not. The two corner names are written once at the grab, the two offsets
-- whenever they change, and the count last: it is what the snippet acts on, it
-- is different every time, and a snippet that hung off the offsets themselves
-- would sit still through a drag straight up the screen, where y moves and x
-- never does.
--
-- The count belongs to the frame and not to the grab that is pushing it. It
-- used to start again at zero every time you took hold of the window, so a
-- one-unit nudge wrote 1, and the next drag's first unit wrote 1 again, which
-- is not a change and ran no snippet: the window sat still until the cursor had
-- gone a second unit. Place below writes through the same count, and a saved
-- anchor put back at login has no grab behind it at all.

-- next login. The cursor answers in physical pixels, the offsets are in the
-- frame's own units, and the scale between them is the division here.
--

-- inside the unit it was in a frame ago, and a point that has not changed is a
-- snippet run and a re-anchor for nothing.

--
-- The drag is taken by the grip where one is named and by the frame where none
-- is. A window is grabbed by its own chrome, so the frame is the grip. A bar
