-- The log
--
-- A column of lines that grows from the bottom, keeps the last few hundred of
-- them, wraps what is too long for the width, and scrolls.
--
-- It is not built out of UI/Stack.lua and UI/Scroll.lua, and that is the one
-- decision in this file worth arguing about. The stack asks every row how tall
-- it is and lays the column out again from the top, which is exactly right for
-- a settings page and exactly wrong here: a line arrives, the whole column
-- reflows, and in a raid that is three hundred measured font strings several
-- times a second. Worse, a font string on a hidden frame does not report its
-- wrapped height on this client, which is why the panel reflows a section only
-- after showing it, and a chat tab you are not looking at is hidden all
-- evening.
--
-- So the log is the client's own ScrollingMessageFrame, which is a frame type
-- rather than a template. UI/Scroll.lua already leans on two of those, the
-- Slider and the ScrollFrame, for the same reason and with the same guard: it
-- is probed with pcall, and a client that refuses it costs the log rather than
-- raising. That frame type has kept a wrapped, capped, scrollable message
-- buffer since the first client and it is what every chat window in the game
-- is made of, including Blizzard's.
--
-- Everything around it is ours. The font is the addon's own shared font object
-- rather than the client's serif, the bar beside it is UI.ScrollBar, the
-- colours are the theme's, and the frame carries no template, no backdrop and
-- no art. What the client contributes is the buffer and the wrap.
--
-- **Nothing fades.** Blizzard's chat frames fade a line out after two minutes,
-- which is fine for a window that is a river you glance at and wrong for one
-- you are meant to be able to read. A line stays until it falls off the end of
-- the buffer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How many lines are kept per log. Each tab holds its own buffer, so this is
-- paid once per tab rather than once for the window. 500 lines of short strings
-- is tens of kilobytes and it is the difference between scrolling back to what
-- somebody said before the pull and not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Standing one up
--
-- Every method that shapes the frame is probed by name rather than called, for
-- the reason the rest of the addon probes: nothing installed on 2.5.6 proves
-- any of them, and one missing method must cost its own feature rather than the
-- window. The two that would be visibly wrong if they were missing are recorded
-- and reported through Describe, because a log that draws upside down and says
-- nothing is worse than one that says why.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- New lines at the bottom, the way every chat window in the game reads.
--
-- A ScrollingMessageFrame made by hand starts at TOP, which puts the newest
-- line above the oldest. The wiki carries a note from the patch that added the
-- method saying the all-caps token is refused and the lower case one works, and
-- another saying the opposite, so it is written and read back and the other
-- case is tried when the first does not take. That is the same shape as the
-- font readback in UI/Text.lua and it exists for the same reason: on this
-- client a refused write is silent.
