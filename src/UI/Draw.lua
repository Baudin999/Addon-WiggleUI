-- window and every bar in the addon.
--
-- It does not hold for a widget whose size is a setting. Pass the frame's own
-- width and height there and each edge gets a length of its own as well as the
-- two anchors, so an edge is a rectangle the client has been given rather than
-- one it has to derive from a frame that was resized under it.

-- The wash
--
-- A rectangle that is solid at one edge and gone at the other. It is what a
-- window puts under its own text when there is no window: the character sheet
-- has no ground by design, so nineteen item names are read against whatever the
-- player happens to be standing on, and a white name on snow is a name you lean
-- in to read.
--
-- Not a texture file with the ramp painted into it, and the third reason is the
-- one that decided it. A file is a fixed number of texels and a row is as wide
-- as its own name, so nineteen rows would stretch one ramp by nineteen amounts
-- and the fade would begin in a different place on each. A file has to be
-- baked, shipped and kept in step with UI.Color, and the colour it would carry
-- is the palette's shadow, which is a decision that lives in Theme.lua and not
-- in art. And the client draws the ramp for nothing: a gradient is four colours
-- on the corners of a quad the hardware was going to interpolate anyway.
--
-- Not a stroke round the letters either. A rim thickens every glyph, costs a
-- second draw of the whole string, and says nothing about where the text ends,
-- which is the half a reader uses to find the row under it.
--
-- Which edge is solid is the caller's, because a row in a right hand column
-- runs the other way. A wash that always ran left to right would put its solid
-- end where that row has no text at all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The axis each solid edge implies, and which of those edges is the gradient's
-- own min end. The client runs a horizontal gradient min at the left and a
-- vertical one min at the bottom.
local WASH_AXIS = {
	LEFT = "HORIZONTAL", RIGHT = "HORIZONTAL",
	BOTTOM = "VERTICAL", TOP = "VERTICAL",
}
local WASH_MIN = { LEFT = true, BOTTOM = true }

-- A texture the caller still has to place and size.
--
-- Unanchored and unsized on purpose. The sheet re-measures its washes after
-- every repaint, off strings that only just took their text, and a primitive
-- that guessed at either would be overwritten on the first paint and misleading
-- until then.
--
-- The far end is the same colour at zero alpha rather than black. A ramp to
-- black goes grey through the middle over anything that is not black, which is
-- exactly the case this exists for: what is behind it is the world.
--
-- White and solid first, because a gradient tints what is drawn rather than
-- replacing it, and a texture with no file and no colour has nothing to tint.
--
-- A client with no gradient gets a flat wash of the same colour at half
-- strength. That is worse and it is legible, which is the trade every probe in
-- this addon makes.
--
-- art is a texture file to wash with instead of white, which is how a feed row
-- is painted with the palette's floor. The colour then tints the painting
-- rather than being the whole of it, and the ramp is the same ramp: a gradient
-- is vertex colour, and vertex colour multiplies a file as it does a solid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Art the client drew
--
-- A solid colour is one texel stretched over a rectangle and there is nothing
-- to get wrong. A spell icon is a 64 texel square being resampled to whatever
-- size the layout asked for, and that is where the mush comes from.
--
-- Two things fix it. The crop has to land on texel boundaries: the border strip
-- baked into every icon is five texels wide, so the coordinate is 5/64 and not
-- 0.08, which cuts 5.12 texels and forces the sampler to interpolate across the
-- whole image to find the edge. And the client's own snapping has to come off:
-- SetSnapToPixelGrid pulls a texture's corners onto whole pixels, which is
-- right for a rectangle of flat colour and wrong for sampled art, because it
-- stretches the two axes by different amounts and the picture inside softens.
-- Both methods are probed, because nothing installed here proves either is on
-- 2.5.6, and an icon that is merely soft is better than a widget that raises.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

end

-- The drawn sizes where one stored texel lands on exactly one pixel, largest
-- first.
--
-- The client keeps each texture at half the size of the one above it and picks
-- the pair nearest the size asked for, so a draw is exact only where the texels
-- the crop leaves halve down to it. Everyone reaches for 64, 32 and 16, and
-- those are the answer for an uncropped texture. Cropping to 54 makes the
-- answer 54 and 27, because 13.5 is not a number of pixels.

-- place to stand is halfway between two of them, where both are weighted
-- equally and neither is the picture.

-- The disc
--
-- A gear icon on the character sheet is round and its last few texels fade out
-- rather than stopping at a line. That is one file, src/Media/Round.tga, doing
-- two jobs, and scripts/bake-round.sh writes it and argues the ramp.
--
-- As a mask it clips the icon. As an ordinary texture, drawn a little wider
-- than the icon and vertex coloured, it is the quality colour the icon's fade
-- lands on, which is the only reason the fade reads as soft rather than as an
-- icon going missing at the edges.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

local ROUND = "Interface\\AddOns\\" .. ADDON .. "\\Media\\Round.tga"

-- Clip a texture into the disc.
--
-- Named Clip rather than Round because UI/Pixel.lua already owns UI.Round, which
-- is the pixel grid rounder thirty callers reach for. This file loads after that
-- one, so the second definition was not a clash anything reported: it replaced
-- the first and every layout in the addon started asking a number for its parent.
--
-- The mask is a texture of its own and has to live somewhere, so it is made on
-- the icon's parent and pinned to the icon rather than to the frame: it then
-- follows every resize and re-anchor the layout does, and no caller has to
-- remember it is there.
--
-- CLAMPTOBLACKADDITIVE on both axes rather than the default wrap. A mask is
-- sampled outside its own bounds wherever the texture under it reaches further,
-- and the default repeats the disc out there, which draws the corners of the
-- icon back in as four more circles.
--
-- Both calls are probed, the way UI.Crisp probes its two, and what comes back is
-- checked as well as the name. They are on 2.5.6 and on the vanilla client, and
-- a square icon is a worse page rather than a broken one. The return is worth a
-- line of its own because the harness is exactly the client that has the name
-- and not the thing: an unwritten method there answers a function that hands
-- back nil, which is how this shipped its first crash.

-- The arc
--
-- A wedge of that same disc, whole when a wait begins and eaten away clockwise
-- from twelve as it runs down. Laid between a ring and the icon sitting inside
-- it, the only part of the wedge anybody sees is the band, and a band cut like
-- that is an arc.
--
-- The client will not draw one. A Cooldown frame draws its swipe over the
-- square it is on, there is no primitive for a sector, and the swipe texture
-- call that would round it off is Legion's: nothing installed here calls it
-- with a TBC interface, and a call the documentation has and the disk does not
-- is how this addon shipped a bug already. So the arc is built, and the build
-- is OPie's, out of UI/Mirage.lua, which does exactly this under
-- `## Interface: 20506`.
--
-- Two textures and two masks. Each texture is half the disc, pinned so its
-- straight edge is down the middle. Each mask is a white rectangle over the
-- right half, and a rectangle turned about the middle of its own left edge is a
-- half plane whose boundary sweeps: at no turn it keeps the right half, at half
-- a turn the left. So the right half of the disc is cut by a mask turning
-- through the first half of the wait, the left half by one turning through the
-- second, and between them they are one wedge with one moving edge.
--
-- The rectangle is half the frame wide and all of it tall, which is exactly the
-- half plane and not a pixel more: every point of a disc inscribed in that
-- frame lies within half a width along the mask's own axis and half a height
-- across it, whichever way it is turned. On a frame that is not square the disc
-- is an ellipse and the far corners of the sweep are approximate. Nothing here
-- draws one on anything but a square.
--
-- A client with no masks gets the whole ring dark while the wait runs and the
-- ring back when it ends. That says the thing worth saying and not how much
-- longer, which is the trade every probe in this file makes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
