--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The theme
--
-- One table of colours and one table of measurements, read by every widget in
-- this layer. They are here rather than written at each site for the reason the
-- font cache is: a number repeated in twenty places is a number that drifts in
-- nineteen of them, and an interface that means to replace Blizzard's has to be
-- able to restate its whole palette in a single edit.
--
-- Every measurement is a whole number of physical pixels. That is only true
-- inside a frame ns.UI.Adopt has taken onto the grid, which is why the window
-- adopts itself and everything below assumes it. Off the grid the numbers are
-- still the right numbers, they just land on fractions of a pixel, which is the
-- look the addon had before the grid existed and is the honest degradation.
--
-- The palette is a saved setting and it is read once. Theme/Theme.lua copies
-- the chosen one over these tables at ADDON_LOADED, before any part has built
-- a frame, and a change of palette takes a /reload. Nothing repaints live, so
-- a palette costs nothing after the load.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Four components, the fourth optional and taken as opaque. Kept as arrays
-- rather than named fields because ns.Fill, ns.Outline and ns.Recolor all count
-- in that order already.
--
-- Only the colours that mean something are written here. The surfaces, the
-- lines, the accent and the text are the palette's, one file per palette in
-- src/Theme/, and they are copied in under this table below.
UI.Color = {
	-- The first destructive control in the addon, and the only one. A button
	-- that deletes an item you cannot get back has to be a different colour
	-- from the button next to it that does nothing, and hover has its own
	-- entry because UI.Button repaints its background on the way in and out.

	-- A number that has gone the wrong way, which so far is one number: the
	-- gold an hour along the bottom of the loot feed, on an hour where the
	-- repair bill beat the drops. Its own entry rather than the danger red
	-- above, because that one is a button you can press by accident and this
	-- is a fact about your afternoon.
	loss     = { 0.86, 0.38, 0.38, 1 },
	-- Who a name belongs to. Three entries, and the mail window is what asks:
	-- a character on your own account, somebody you know, and everybody else.
	--
	-- Their own entries rather than the three colours above that happen to be
	-- the right hues. `tick` is a box you ticked, `accent` is a control you can
	-- press and `loss` is a number that went the wrong way, and none of the
	-- three is a fact about a person. A palette that says the same thing twice
	-- drifts on the first edit that meant one of them and not the other.
	--
	-- Red for a stranger is deliberate and it is not an error state. Mailing
	-- somebody you have never mailed is a thing you may well want to do; the
	-- colour is there so that doing it by accident, with a stack of ore or half
	-- your gold on the mail, is a thing you cannot do without seeing it.

	-- Why an item matters to you, one colour per reason Core/Need.lua answers
	-- and keyed by the word it answers, so a fourth reason is a fourth entry
	-- here and nothing else.
	--
	-- The orange is the one the loot feed already rings a quest item with, and
	-- it is the only orange in the addon: gold is what the coin rows are and
	-- what the account's own accent is, and a quest marker in that colour is a
	-- marker you have to work out. Green for a reagent still worth a point,
	-- because the answer it stands for is yes. Grey for what the loot filter
	-- would have left, because trash is the commonest of the three and the one
	-- nobody is looking for.
	--
	-- Their own entries rather than the three above that are already those
	-- hues, for the reason the three names above them have theirs: `heading`,
	-- `tick` and `quiet` are a title, a box you ticked and a line you are meant
	-- to skip, and none of the three is a reason to keep an item.

-- The palette's entries, built from dark because the saved variables that say
-- which palette was chosen have not arrived yet. Copies rather than the
-- palette's own tables: Theme/Theme.lua writes the chosen palette into these
-- in place at ADDON_LOADED, and writing into dark's own tables would lose dark.
-- Its unit table is Unit/Color.lua's and is skipped here.

-- What an item's grade is drawn in, keyed by the number the client grades on.
--
-- ITEM_QUALITY_COLORS is the client's own and would do for the numbers, but
-- every guard in UI/Feed.lua compares a colour by table identity, so a palette
-- read fresh out of the client on each row would fail every one of those guards
-- and repaint a colour that had not changed. These are stable references, which
-- is the same reason Unit/Color.lua owns its own tables.
--
-- The numbers are the client's where it will say and the game's well known ones
-- where it will not, so a client with no ITEM_QUALITY_COLORS draws the right
-- colours rather than eight greys.
--
-- Here rather than in Feeds/Loot.lua, where it was written, because the quest
-- log's reward column is a second reader and a part may not name a file outside
-- its own tree. A palette with two readers is a palette, which is what this
-- file is for.

	-- 180 while the addon drew in Arial Narrow. The face is Noto Sans now and it
	-- is 27 per cent wider at the same pixel height, so seven of the forty five
	-- section titles ran off the end of their line. The fixed part of a rail row
	-- is the indent and the air round it and none of that got wider, so the
	-- column grew by what the letters grew by rather than by 27 per cent: 126
	-- pixels of text room became 162.
	rail     = 216,

	-- that is the whole of it: a word costs sixty pixels of every line anybody
	-- said to name a room you already know by sight, and thirteen of them cost a
	-- quarter of the window. The name is in the hover.
	--
	-- These six numbers are the chat window's only ones, and they are smaller
	-- than the settings window's equivalents on purpose. A settings window is
	-- opened, read and shut; a control in it is a thing you aim at once. The
	-- chat window is up all evening beside the game, and every pixel its rail,
	-- its field and its margins take is a pixel the conversation does not get.
	-- It is furniture, so it is drawn at furniture size.

	-- The log's margin from the rail and from the window's own edge. Half the

	-- The count in the corner of an item square, and the only string in the
	-- addon that gets its own number. It is read at a glance across a bag of
	-- eighty four squares rather than looked at, it carries no word to guess
	-- the digits from, and it stands on a picture the addon did not paint.
	--
	-- Fourteen because it is UI.OutlineFloor exactly. Under the floor the
	-- number takes a shadow, which is one dark corner and leaves a pale 4 on a
	-- pale icon still half gone; at the floor it can take the rim instead, and
	-- a rim is dark on every side of every stroke. So this is the smallest size
	-- at which the count is legible on any icon in the game, which is what it
	-- has to be. It is also the largest that fits: three digits at fourteen is
	-- twenty four pixels across a twenty seven pixel picture. That was twenty
	-- before the face changed and it is the tightest this number has ever been.
	-- It cannot come down to buy the room back either, because thirteen is under
	-- the outline floor and the paragraph above is what that costs.
	tally    = 14,
	-- A chevron or a cross in the glyph face. Two under the body size, because a
	-- Font Awesome mark fills its em box while a letter of the text face uses
	-- about two thirds of one, so matching the numbers would draw an arrow half
	-- again the height of the word beside it.
	glyph    = 10,

	-- A strength rather than a length, and the only one in here.
	--
	-- How brightly a surface paints an item's grade with nothing pointing at
	-- it. Nineteen quality colours at full strength is a page of coloured
	-- lights and thirteen feed rows of it is a column of them; at this they are
	-- a tint you read without being shouted at, and the hover is what takes one
	-- to full. Character/Paperdoll.lua rests a quality band at it and UI/Feed.lua
	-- rests a row's stripe at it, and the two windows are drawing the same
	-- picture, so they are drawing it off the same number.

-- setting and the rail, the scroll bar and the button at the foot of the rail
-- were drawn at their own opaque alpha over it, so a window at twenty percent
-- was a pane of glass with three black rectangles floating on it.
--
-- The fraction cannot be an argument to UI.Tint, because most of the calls to
-- it are repaints: a row of the rail is retinted on the way past with the
-- cursor and on selection, a button on hover, and a site that forgot to pass
-- the fraction would paint the surface solid again on the first mouse move. So
-- it is a property of the texture, written once by whoever owns the window and
