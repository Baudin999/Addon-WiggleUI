--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- An ability, drawn
--
-- One square that says what an ability is, whether a press would land it, and
-- how long until it would. Every icon in this addon that stands for something
-- castable is one of these: the charge button on the HUD, the marker in the
-- world, and the buttons on the bars.
--
-- It was written twice before this file existed and the two copies had already
-- started to drift. Charge/Icon.lua and Charge/Marker.lua both build a black
-- backing texture, a cropped icon, a cooldown swipe with the client's numbers
-- turned off and a timer string of their own, then recolour a border and
-- desaturate the art from one shared status. The same square, the same six
-- writes, the same guard. What differed was an accident: the icon had a border
-- it recoloured through SetColorTexture on a single background texture, the
-- marker had one too, and neither could grow a range tint without the other
-- being edited to match.
--
-- Three calls, split by when they run rather than by what reads tidily, which
-- is the split UI/Gauge.lua already uses.
--
--   Ability.New       allocates. Once per button.
--   Ability.Size      lays the square out. On a settings change or a rescale.
--   Ability.Draw      runs on a ticker against every square on the screen, so
--                     it allocates nothing and writes nothing already there.
--                     check.sh's HOT list holds it to that.
--
-- What a square answers to the hand, as opposed to what it says about the
-- game, is here too and was the thing missing when the bars did not feel like
-- buttons. Three pieces, all of them free:
--
--   A highlight under the cursor, drawn on the HIGHLIGHT layer, which the
--   client shows and hides itself for any frame that takes the mouse. No
--   script, no per-tick work.
--
--   A pushed tint on the way down, which the Button widget draws itself for
--   whatever SetPushedTexture was handed. Buttons only; a plain frame has no
--   such state and the marker in the world is not something you press.
--
--   An active ring and tint, for the one square whose ability is already what
--   is running: the stance you are standing in, the auto attack already
--   swinging, the Heroic Strike queued onto the next swing. That one is not
--   free, because nothing in the client knows to draw it, so it is an argument
--   to Ability.Draw like every other fact about the square.
--
--   It started as the tint alone, at 22% additive gold over a 27 pixel icon,
--   and that is not visible on art that is already bright. Queueing Heroic
--   Strike is the case that proved it: the one press in a warrior's rotation
--   whose whole answer is "it is armed and it goes off on the next swing", and
--   the square said nothing you could see. Blizzard draws a checked border for
--   the same fact. So does this now, and the tint stays underneath it, because
--   the ring is the edge and the fill is what makes the square read as lit
--   rather than as outlined.
--
-- And a green ring for an item you are wearing, which is what Blizzard's own
-- buttons draw for the same fact. It is a second outline one pixel inside the
-- first rather than a recolour of it, because the outer edge already carries
-- the status and being equipped is not a status: a wielded weapon can be on
-- cooldown and out of range at once, and all three are worth saying.
--
-- What this file does not do, and will not: decide what an ability is doing.
-- It is handed a status and draws it. Charge/Charge.lua works out the status
-- for the three charge abilities against a picked unit; Buttons/Slot.lua works
-- it out for an action slot. Those two are different questions with the same
-- ten answers, and keeping the answers here is what stops a third display
-- inventing an eleventh.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The vocabulary
--
-- Ten statuses and six looks. The statuses are reasons and are the same
-- everywhere; the looks are what a reason is worth on screen and are not.
--
-- Splitting them is the whole design of this file. A status is a fact about
-- the game: you have no rage, the mob is too far, you are in the wrong stance.
-- A look is an editorial decision about how loudly to say it, and the right
-- volume depends on how many squares are on screen. One charge icon in the
-- middle of the view can afford to go green when it is ready, because green
-- means "now" and there is nothing to compare it against. Twenty-four bar
-- buttons cannot: a wall of green says nothing at all, and the state worth
-- shouting about there is the one that is wrong.
--
-- So the status to outcome map below is shared and the outcome to look map is
-- the caller's, chosen at Ability.New.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Every reason a press does or does not land, in the order a source should
-- test them: what cannot be fixed at all, then what a few seconds or a stance
-- swap fixes, then range. Named here rather than in each source so a display
-- cannot be handed a status no palette has a colour for.
Ability.STATUS = {
	empty     = true, -- the slot holds nothing
	unknown   = true, -- there is an ability, this character cannot cast it
	cooldown  = true, -- on cooldown, longer than the global
	reaction  = true, -- a reactive ability whose window is shut
	condition = true, -- the fight has not met what the ability waits on
	combat    = true, -- right ability, wrong side of the combat line
	notarget  = true, -- nothing to cast it on
	stance    = true, -- wrong stance, or unusable for a reason that is not cost
	cost      = true, -- not enough rage, mana, energy or focus
	range     = true, -- everything else is fine and the unit is too far
	ready     = true, -- press it
}

-- Which of the six looks a status is worth. Everything absent is "no", which
-- is where cooldown, wrong stance and an empty slot all land: the reasons
-- differ, and the answer to "would a press do the thing" does not.
--
-- Range and cost are pulled out of "no" on purpose, and they are the only two
-- that are. Both are states you can act on within a second or two, one by
-- walking and one by waiting, and both are what you are actually asking a bar
-- when you glance at it mid-fight. Cooldown is not in that group because the
-- swipe already says it, in more detail than a colour could.
--
-- Cost keeps the drain that "no" has, and that is the one look in the table
-- that says the same thing twice. It has to, because this addon draws no rage
-- bar and no mana bar on the bars themselves: what you can afford right now is
-- readable off the squares or it is not readable anywhere. A hairline of blue
-- on a 27 pixel square is a thing you find when you go looking for it, and the
-- question "what can I press" is asked with the eye moving, not stopping. The
-- drained art answers it at a glance and the blue edge says which of the two
-- kinds of no it is once the eye has landed.
--
-- Range does not get the drain, and the asymmetry is deliberate. Out of range
-- is a fact about one mob and it goes away when you take a step; out of rage
-- is a fact about you and it is the one that decides what to press.
--
-- Reaction is a new reason and takes no new look, which is the answer the two
-- paragraphs above ask for rather than a way of avoiding the question. A shut
-- Overpower window is not a state you can act on. You cannot walk out of it and
-- you cannot wait it out on purpose; it opens when the mob dodges you and never
-- otherwise, so there is nothing for a colour to tell you to do. That is the
-- definition of "no", and four of the ten statuses already sit there for the
-- same reason.
--
-- What says the window opened is the square leaving "no". On a bar that is a
-- jump from 55% drained grey to full colour, which is a bigger change than any
-- border in this table makes and is the one thing the eye catches in a row of
-- twenty-four. Giving the shut state its own colour would put a permanent
-- coloured edge on two squares for the length of every fight, which is the wall
-- of colour the paragraph at the top of this file argues against, and it would
-- spend that colour on the state you are meant to ignore.
--
-- Condition and notarget take no new look either, and for the reason reaction
-- does not. A target above a fifth of its health is not a state you can act on:
-- you cannot walk out of it, you cannot wait it out on purpose, and the fight
-- will hand it to you or it will not. That is the definition of "no". What says
-- Execute has come in is the square leaving "no", which on a bar is a jump from
-- 55% drained grey to full colour and is the biggest change any square makes.
--
-- Swap is drained, and it did not used to be. That was the defect this table
-- shipped with. Wrong stance is the one outcome here where the press will not
-- land and the art was drawn at ready brightness anyway, so the whole of what
-- the square said was an orange hairline, and a Whirlwind in Battle Stance read
-- as pressable across the room. The rule the rest of the table already follows
-- is the one it now follows: a fact about you drains the art, a fact about the
-- mob does not. Out of rage drains, out of range does not, and wrong stance is
-- a fact about you. The orange keeps saying there is something you can do about
-- it, which is what makes it worth a colour of its own rather than the grey.
--
-- Empty is pulled out for a different reason than range and cost are, and it is
-- the one that made a half filled bar look broken. An empty slot has no art, so
-- it fell to "no" and was drawn as the fallback question mark at 55% alpha:
-- twelve grey question marks where Blizzard's bar had twelve holes. `blank`
-- says draw no art at all, which is what a hole looks like.
--
-- Drawn at full alpha rather than faded, which looks backwards and is not. With
-- `blank` there is no art left to fade, so the alpha only reaches the black
-- backing and the hairline, and fading those leaves a drop target you cannot
-- see. Buttons/Bars.lua lets you drag a spell onto a square, so where the holes
-- are is a thing the bar has to answer. This is also why there is no grid: the
-- client shows one on ACTIONBAR_SHOWGRID because its bar has no background to
-- see a hole against, and this one is squares on a box.

-- One square, one tick. `texture` is the art, `status` one of Ability.STATUS,
-- `start` and `duration` the cooldown when there is one, `count` a stack or
-- charge number, `active` whether the ability is already what is running, and
-- `equipped` whether the item in the slot is worn.
--
-- Deliberately eight arguments rather than one table. A table would be an
-- allocation per square per tick, which at twenty-four buttons five times a
-- second is a hundred and twenty throwaway tables a second to say what eight
-- values already say.
--
-- Eight is the ceiling and the last two are both booleans, which is the shape
-- that gets passed in the wrong order eventually. A ninth fact about a square
-- is the point at which this takes a table built once per widget and mutated,
-- rather than one more positional flag.
--
-- `start` and `duration` are the swipe and are drawn whenever they are given.
-- `status` says whether the swipe also gets a number over it, and it is only
-- "cooldown" for a wait longer than the global. That split is the difference
-- between a bar that answers a press and one that does not: below the global
-- there is nothing to count down, and a bar that drew nothing at all there was
-- a bar where pressing a rage dump changed no pixel on the screen.
