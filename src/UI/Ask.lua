-- One question, and two buttons
--
-- The addon asks a player to confirm exactly one kind of thing: something that
-- cannot be undone. Abandoning a quest is the first of them, and the shape of
-- the question is the same every time it is asked, so it is one window rather
-- than one per site.
--
-- **It replaces a button that arms itself.** The quest log used to abandon on
-- the second press of the same button, with a line in the chat window between
-- the two saying what the second press would do. That is a real confirmation
-- and it has two faults. The sentence is in a window you may not be looking at,
-- and the state is invisible: a button that says "abandon it" instead of
-- "abandon" is the whole of the warning, and a player who pressed once and got
-- distracted comes back to a button that is one click from throwing a quest
-- away. A window in the middle of the screen cannot be missed and cannot be
-- pressed by accident.
--
-- **One window, reused.** Every popup in this addon is built once and repainted,
-- for the reason UI/Widgets.lua's dropdown gives: this client cannot destroy a
-- frame, so a window made per question is a window leaked per question. It also
-- means two questions cannot be on the screen at once, which is the behaviour
-- you want: the second would cover the first and both would be about something
-- irreversible.
--
-- **What it does not do is take the mouse away from the game.** A real modal
-- dims the world and eats every click, and none of that is worth the frame
-- level fight on a client where another addon may be doing the same thing. The
-- question is on top, it has the two buttons, and closing it any other way is
-- the same answer as no.
