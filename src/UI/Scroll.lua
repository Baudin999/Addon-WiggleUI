-- Scrolling
--
-- A viewport that clips, a canvas that moves inside it, and a bar on the right
-- that shows where you are and can be dragged.
--
-- Three client questions had to be answered before any of it, and all three are
-- probed rather than assumed, because nothing installed on 2.5.6 proves any of
-- them and a settings window that raises is worse than one that does not
-- scroll.
--
-- Clipping. SetClipsChildren is the direct way and is preferred where it
-- answers, because it is one method on an ordinary frame and the canvas is then
-- an ordinary child that moves by its anchor. Where it is missing the viewport
-- is built as a ScrollFrame instead, which is a frame type rather than a
-- template, has existed since the first client, and clips its scroll child by
-- construction. Where neither answers there is no clipping at all: the content
-- is placed and nothing is hidden, which looks wrong on a long page and is
-- still a window you can read.
--
-- The bar. It is a Slider, again a frame type and not a template, with a thumb
-- texture this file draws. That is deliberate: dragging a thumb means following
-- the cursor, following the cursor means an OnUpdate, and an OnUpdate on a
-- settings window is a ticker the addon then has to defend forever. The client
-- already tracks a slider's drag for us and reports it once per change, so the
-- whole cost is one OnValueChanged. Where the Slider type is refused the wheel
-- still scrolls and there is no bar.
--
-- The wheel. EnableMouseWheel on the viewport, probed by name. Children do not
-- swallow it unless they enable it themselves, and none of the widgets does.
--
-- The bar column is reserved whether or not the bar is showing. Handing the
-- width back when the content happens to fit would rewrap every note, which can
-- make the content taller, which brings the bar back, which takes the width
-- away again. A layout that can argue with itself is a layout that flickers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Which way up the track is
--
-- **A vertical slider on this client runs upside down.** Its minimum is at the
-- bottom of the track and its maximum at the top, so dragging the thumb
-- downward reports a smaller value and not a larger one.
--
-- Everything in this addon that scrolls counts from the top: offset zero is
-- the first line of the content, and the offset grows as you go down. Written
-- straight into the slider, that gave a bar whose thumb sat at the bottom while
-- the page was at the top, and a drag that moved the page the other way from
-- the hand holding it. The quest log is where it was caught, and the wheel is
-- why it took so long to see: the wheel never goes through the slider, so it
-- scrolled correctly on the same list, in the same window, at the same time.
--
-- The three files that own one of these bars all count from the top, so the
-- flip lives here, once, in the file that makes the widget. A caller says where
-- it is from the top and is told where it is from the top, and nothing outside
-- this file has to know which way round the client's track is.

--
-- Both of these write only what is not already there. A chat window takes a
-- line a second in a city and a feed takes one a swing in a fight, and the
-- steady state of either is a bar that is already where it belongs; the guard
-- is here rather than at the three call sites because it is the widget's own
