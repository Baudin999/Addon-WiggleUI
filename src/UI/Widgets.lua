-- The widgets
--
-- Everything the interface is made of that is not a rectangle. A push button, a
-- tick box, a stepper, a value you drag, a cycling value, a value picked off a
-- list, a key capture field, a line of text you type, a strip of buttons where
-- one is chosen, a slot you drop an item into, a character with those slots
-- under it, and a paragraph of prose that sizes itself.
--
-- Two rules run through all of them and they are the two the panel this
-- replaced broke.
--
-- Every row measures itself. A widget that carries text hands the stack a
-- measure function, the stack sets the row's width before it asks, and the
-- answer is the wrapped height of the text plus whatever the control next to it
-- needs. Nothing here is given a height by whoever wrote the call site, so no
-- string can be longer than the room the layout guessed for it.
--
-- Nothing here knows what a setting is. A widget takes a getter and a setter
-- and reports what it did to its host. That is what lets the same kit build the
-- options panel today and an aura tracker or a loot window later without this
-- file learning either of their names.
--
-- Built out of CreateFrame and coloured textures, the way the rest of the addon
-- is. Every Blizzard widget template is one more thing that has to exist on
-- 2.5.6, and this file leans on none of them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The two ranges that are one range.
--
-- Zoom and background were declared at the top of four and three feature files
-- respectively, the same numbers written seven times. They are here so the kit
-- calls below can supply them, and public so the slash words that take the same
-- number can read them rather than keeping a private copy that drifts.
UI.ZOOM_LOW, UI.ZOOM_HIGH, UI.ZOOM_STEP = 0.5, 3, 0.1
UI.ALPHA_LOW, UI.ALPHA_HIGH, UI.ALPHA_STEP = 0, 100, 5

-- One range, where there used to be two that disagreed.
--
-- The HUD parts ran 1 to 3 in whole steps and the windows ran 0.5 to 3 in
-- quarters, and the argument for the whole step was that a widget you read mid
-- swing is worth keeping exact. That argument is about one stop being better
-- than another, not about the other stops being unreachable, and it was being
-- enforced by making them unreachable. A tenth is the step now, for every part
-- of the addon, and UI.Exact is what says which stops keep a hairline sharp.
--
-- Snapped rather than passed through, because the stepper accumulates: ten
-- presses of + from 1 is 1.9999999999999998 in a double, and a readout that
-- says 2x while UI.Exact says the frame is not on a whole number is a readout
-- that is lying about which of those stops you are on.

	value = tonumber(value) or 1

	end
	local steps = math.floor((value - UI.ZOOM_LOW) / UI.ZOOM_STEP + 0.5)
	return UI.ZOOM_LOW + steps * UI.ZOOM_STEP
end

-- "1x", "1.4x", "2.5x". Two decimals with the dead zeros taken off, so a tenth
-- reads as one digit and a whole number carries none. Settings/Settings.lua had
-- this written out; it delegates here now, because a label for a zoom and the
-- range that zoom is drawn from are the same fact.
function UI.ZoomLabel(value)
	local text = ("%.2f"):format(UI.ZoomSnap(value))
	text = (text:gsub("0+$", ""))
	text = (text:gsub("%.$", ""))
	return text .. "x"
end

-- At most one of each in the whole interface, which is the behaviour you want
-- and also the reason they are module state rather than per kit. Two open
-- dropdowns is a bug, and two fields listening for the same keypress is worse.
--
-- `typing` is the third of them and the one that was missing. An edit box with
-- the keyboard takes every press before a frame's OnKeyDown ever sees it, so a
-- search field holding focus meant a key field captured nothing and the key you
-- pressed was typed into the search instead. Tracked here rather than in the
-- window, because the field that has to give the keyboard up is in the chrome
-- and the thing that needs it is a widget on a page, and neither knows the
-- other exists.

-- replaces what it acts on, the second press lands on something nobody looked

-- answers true once and then false for DEBOUNCE. One is built per thing that
-- can be pressed twice and asked inside the press, so a macro calling the same
-- function is held to it too.
--
-- Nil until the first press rather than nought, because GetTime counts from
-- when the client started and a press in its first 0.4 seconds is still a press.

-- Slots
--
-- One square you drop something onto, and the two things built out of it: a
-- labelled row, and a character with its hands under it.
--
-- get() returns the icon to draw and the text to say about it, and either
-- may be nil: no icon draws the empty-slot art opts.empty hands over, no
-- text leaves the line blank. opts.take is handed the whole of GetCursorInfo
-- and answers the one value set() gets, or nil to refuse the drop; with none
-- named a square takes an item and hands over its link. set() returns whether
-- it took it, which is where the rule that a shield does not go in a main
-- hand lives, because this file knows about neither shields nor spells.
--
-- A drop arrives two ways because neither is reliable on its own.
-- OnReceiveDrag does not fire when the drop replaced something already on
-- the cursor, and OnMouseUp does not fire when the press that started the
-- drag happened somewhere else. OPie's ring editor registers both and then
-- polls on top; the poll is an OnUpdate, which this layer is not allowed to
-- add, so the two handlers are where it stops.
--
-- The highlight asks opts.take rather than watching the cursor, for the same
-- reason. It was CursorHasItem, which never answers for a spell.
--
-- A square can be dragged out of as well as dropped onto, and that is two hooks
-- because a drag has two ends and only the page knows what happens at either.
-- opts.drag is the square being emptied, and the page is what decides whether
-- anything rides the cursor out of it. opts.landed is the button coming up,
-- wherever it came up, which is the only thing a square whose contents will not
-- go on the cursor has to go on: an equipped trinket cannot be picked up and
-- carried to another square without unequipping it, and picking it up is not
-- what the drag meant.
--
-- opts.carried takes a drag the client's cursor cannot hold, through
-- UI/Carry.lua: it is handed whatever that drag lifted and answers the value
-- set() gets, or nil to refuse it, the same as opts.take does for the cursor.
--
-- opts.describe is what the square says to a hover, in ns.Tip's own terms. It
-- is folded into the highlight rather than hung with ns.Tip.Hang, because both
-- want OnEnter and the second one to be set wins.
--
-- Module scope rather than inside the kit, because a page that lays out its own
-- row wants the square without the label and the stack cell around it. opts.after
-- is what the kit passes its own refresh in; a caller outside the kit passes
-- whatever puts its page back in step.

-- The kit
--
-- One kit per page. The host is whatever is holding the page and answers four
-- questions:
--
--   host.stack        the stack rows are added to right now
--   host.Section(t)   open a section titled t and return the stack for it,
--                     optional, and without it a section is a heading row
--   host.Refresh()    put the whole host back in step after a widget changed
--                     something, optional, and without it the kit refreshes
--                     only its own rows
--   host.Popup()      the frame a dropdown should parent to, optional
--
-- That is the entire contract. A future window builds a page by making a stack,
-- making a kit over it, and calling the same functions the seven feature parts
-- already call.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Refreshing
--
-- Every row registers what puts it back in step with whatever it is showing, so
-- one refresh after any change covers the lot, no matter whether the change came
-- from a click here or from a slash command.
--
-- Only the rows on a page that is on the screen. A refresh is one getter per row
-- and the getters are not cheap: they walk your bags, your spellbook, your
-- factions and Questie's lists. The options window holds sixty five pages and
-- shows one of them, so a click on a tick box used to run sixty four pages of
-- client calls whose answers nobody could see. The page that comes up next is
-- refreshed as it comes up, which is where the work belongs.
--
-- Nothing refreshes at the moment it is built either. Every row used to run its
-- getter as it was made and then again on the first refresh after, which is one
-- whole extra walk of every getter in the window for nothing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The index
--
-- Every control records what it is called as it is built, and the host says
-- where that is: which section, and which group that section named. Nothing in
-- this file reads the index back. It is what the options window's search field
-- walks and what the harness counts labels out of, and a control that forgot to
-- register is a control search cannot find.
--
-- So it is one call at the end of each constructor rather than a walk over the
-- frames afterwards, which would have to guess which font string on a row was
-- the label. A label is a string, or a function for the rows whose label says
-- what pressing them would do right now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Sections and the groups they name
--
-- kit.Section opens a section and says which group of the options window it
-- belongs in. Both are the caller's to choose, which is the point: a group is
-- what somebody was thinking about when they opened the window, and a feature
-- is a folder of code. UnitFrames is the case that settles it. Its three
-- sections are two about your own frames and one about enemy nameplates, and
-- until a section could name its own group those three had to share a rail
-- entry called after the folder they happen to live in.
--
-- Where the host has somewhere to put sections, which is what the options
-- window's rail and tab strip are, the rows after the call go on that tab's own
-- stack. Where it has not, the title is a heading rule in the same column and
-- the group is not used, because there is nothing to file it under.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Prose, in three capped kinds
--
-- There used to be one call, Note, and one note per control: a hundred and
-- thirty four of them holding forty thousand characters, about fifteen pages of
-- writing with switches embedded in it. They did three different jobs and the
-- window drew all three the same way, so the one sentence a control actually
-- needed was buried in four paragraphs about why the pixel grid prefers whole
-- stops.
--
-- So there are three calls now and each of them is capped, because a cap is the
-- only thing that has ever stopped this growing back. What the caps push out
-- goes to docs/README.md, which is where explaining the addon belongs and which
-- can be read on a second monitor while the game runs.
--
-- Installed onto a kit rather than written inside UI.Kit, because these three
-- are one subject and the kit's body is a list of controls. `ctx` is the handful
-- of closures every row in this file is built out of: the stack a row lands on,
-- the frame it parents to, a wrapping label, the width that label gets, and the
-- register-for-refresh call.

	--
	-- Costing no space was the half that worked. The other half was that nothing

-- The four knobs every part reinvented
--
-- Zoom, background, width and rows. Each of them had been written once per
-- part, with the range declared at the top of that part's own file, and the
-- copies had drifted: four separate `LOW_ZOOM, HIGH_ZOOM = 1, 3` pairs, three
-- separate 0-to-100-in-fives, and the same idea called `bar opacity` on one
-- page, `background` on two others and `list bars` where every other page says
-- `rows`.
--
-- So the range lives here where the range is genuinely one range, and the label
-- lives here where the label is genuinely one label. Where the range really does
-- differ per caller, which is every pixel measurement, the caller keeps it and
-- this file supplies the unit.
--
-- Every one of these is a composition of Stepper or Slider and nothing else, so
-- they are installed rather than written inside the kit for the same reason the
-- prose is.

-- A row of a label and a control
--
-- Out here rather than inside UI.Kit, because it belongs to no one kit and
-- because the argument for the third return below is a paragraph the kit's own
-- body should not have to carry. It takes ctx for the same three calls every
-- installer out here takes it for.
-- Shared by every row that is a label on the left and a control on the right.
-- The label wraps and the row is as tall as the taller of the two, so a long
-- label pushes the row down rather than running under its own control.
--
-- Three things come back and the third is the one to read carefully. `right`
-- is what a control anchors its TOPRIGHT to, not the row, and it stops short of
-- the row by the width of a hint's `?` whether or not the row has a hint. A
-- row without one used to reserve nothing, and its buttons then sat one column
-- to the right of the rows above and below it that did.
