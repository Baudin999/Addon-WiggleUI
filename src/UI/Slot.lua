--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The item square, and the headings over a column of them
--
-- Two things, in one file, because a window that draws items draws both and
-- neither is worth a file on its own. The bag window and the merchant window
-- are the two today; a bank, a loot window, a trade window and an auction house
-- are the same two pieces again.
--
-- **A square is a sunken ground, a hairline in the item's own grade, a crisp
-- icon and a count in the corner.** That is the whole definition and it is here
-- so that there is one of it. It was written twice, once in Bags/Grid.lua and
-- once in Merchant/Grid.lua, and the two windows are open beside each other at
-- a vendor: two squares that differ by a pixel of inset or a shade of grey is
-- the defect this file exists to make impossible rather than to fix.
--
-- **What is not here is what each window does with it.** A bag square is built
-- on the client's own bag button, carries a cooldown swirl, wears a coin when a
-- vendor will pay for what is on it and holds the count of the whole empty pile
-- when the pile folds into it. A merchant square carries none of that and sits
-- at the left of a row with a price on it. Every one of those is a fact about
-- one window and stays in that window's file. The line between the two is
-- drawn at "does this square look different", not at "does this square do
-- something different".
--
-- **Dressing and undressing are two calls because they are two situations.** A
-- square this addon makes arrives blank and only needs dressing. A square built
-- on one of the client's own templates arrives wearing a gold border, a
-- parchment stack count, a quickslot plate and a lit blue square over the whole
-- slot, all drawn for a window that looks nothing like either of these, and has
-- to be swept first. Bags/Grid.lua's header carries the argument for why that
-- sweep takes every region rather than a list of named ones.
--
-- **The grade rule is two colours and no more.** An item the client grades
-- white or grey takes the theme's own edge; everything above that takes its
-- grade. A window where every square has a coloured rim is a window with no
-- colour in it, and white and grey are what nearly everything you carry and
-- nearly everything on a vendor's rack is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- One square, and the gap to the next.
--
-- Thirty one leaves twenty seven pixels of picture once the two pixel inset
-- either side is taken off, and twenty seven is one of the two sizes an icon is
-- drawn at exactly on this client: the stored texture is sixty four texels, the
-- crop takes it to fifty four, and fifty four halves to twenty seven. Any other
-- number is a blend of two stored copies.
--
-- The gap is two rather than three because the square already draws its own
-- hairline. A rim and a rim with two pixels between them read as separated; the
-- third pixel is spent on nothing and there are twelve of those gaps down a
-- full bag.
UI.SLOT, UI.SLOT_GAP, UI.SLOT_INSET = 31, 2, 2

-- The air between the two lanes of a pile that is drawn in two.
--
-- Half a square, which is the smallest gap that reads as a division rather than
-- a wider gap between two squares. The bag window's equipment piles are split
-- down the middle -- what is already bound to you on the left, what is still
-- free to sell or give away on the right -- and the two halves have to be
-- tellable apart at a glance without a rule drawn between them.
--
-- Every other pile in that window is one lane of the full width, and the window
-- carries this much air at its right edge instead, so the two kinds of pile end
-- at the same place.
--
-- **It is a design number and the caller has to snap it.** Every other distance
-- in that grid is a whole number of square pitches, so every square in a row
-- lands on the same fraction of a pixel as the one before it and they all
-- rasterise the same way. A lane offset that is not a whole number of pixels
-- puts the second lane on a different fraction from the first, and a hairline
-- one pixel wide on the wrong fraction is a hairline the client draws on
-- neither of the two pixels it falls between. That is not hypothetical: at half
-- a pixel it took the right edge off the last square of the left lane and the
-- left edge off the first square of the right, and left every other edge in the
-- window alone. Bags/Grid.lua puts this through UI.Round for that reason, and a
-- whole number of pixels between the lanes means the second lane's squares
-- share the first lane's fractions exactly.
UI.SLOT_LANE = math.floor(UI.SLOT / 2)

-- What is left of a square you cannot act on: something a vendor will not take,
-- something he has run out of, something you cannot pay for. Dim enough to read
-- as unavailable beside a square next to it that is not, and not so dim that
-- you cannot see what the item is. The point is to say which of the things in
-- front of you the moment is about, not to hide the rest.
UI.SLOT_DIM = 0.4

-- And how faint one is that is spoken for: on the letter in the mail window,
-- still in the bag, still yours. Lighter than the refusal above on purpose. A
-- square a vendor will not take is out of the question while you are standing
-- at him and wants to be out of the way; one that is already on a mail is a
-- square you are still counting, and it has to stay readable while you count.
UI.SLOT_SPOKEN = 0.6

-- The line a pile's name sits on, and the air under the last row of one pile
-- before the next name.
--
-- Both are the smallest they can be and still do their job, because a full bag
-- is sixteen piles and every pixel here is paid sixteen times. The heading is
-- the heading face plus three, which is a line box for a thirteen pixel font
-- and nothing else; M.row is twenty because it is sized for a control with a
-- tick box in it, and there is no control here. The break is one row gap rather
-- than two: what separates two piles is the heading under the air, not the air.
UI.SLOT_HEADER, UI.SLOT_BREAK = M.heading + 3, M.rowGap
-- The line a section's caption sits on: Equipment over the weapons and armour.
-- The small face plus the same three, for the same reason, and dim rather than
-- the heading colour so a pile's own heading is still the thing the eye lands
-- on.
UI.SLOT_SUBHEADER = M.small + 3

-- How wide a line of this many squares is.
--
-- Here rather than in the window that asks because it is the square and the
-- gap, and those are this file's. The bag window sizes itself off it. The
-- merchant window used to as well and no longer does: its unit is a card with a
-- name and a price on it rather than a bare square, so Merchant/Grid.lua owns
-- that width and says why.

-- an item's name beside its square wants. The floor is the body colour rather
-- than the edge colour, because a white item's name has to be readable and its

-- Building one
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- One region a template drew, drawing nothing.
--
-- Three writes rather than one, because no single one of them holds on every
-- build. The file is cleared, so a region the client's own update shows again
-- has nothing in it. The alpha goes to zero, so one whose file is written again
-- draws nothing either. And ns.Strip puts Hide on the Show method, which is how
-- the rest of the addon answers Blizzard code that turns its regions back on.
--
-- Every call is guarded on its own type. A frame answers a method for anything
-- asked of it by capitalised name, so a call a build does not have reads as a
-- function rather than as nil, and a font string has no SetTexture at all.
