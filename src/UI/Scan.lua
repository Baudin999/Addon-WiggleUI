-- The client's own tooltip text, read out as data
--
-- An item's stats, an action slot's rank and cost, a debuff's description: all
-- of it is computed inside the game and there is no API that hands any of it
-- over. The one supported way to read it is to point a tooltip of your own at
-- the thing, let the client fill it in, and read the font strings back. That is
-- what this file does, and it is the only file in the addon that names
-- GameTooltip.
--
-- **That is the whole reason it exists.** Before this, six files each held their
-- own version of the same conversation with the client, and each one drew its
-- answer in Blizzard's parchment while everything beside it drew in the addon's
-- chrome. A hovered action square raised a gold-bordered scroll; the cooldown
-- square eight pixels below it raised a flat black box. Reading the text out as
-- data is what lets both be drawn the same way.
--
-- **A kind, not a method.** A caller asks for `action` or `debuff` and never
-- names a client function, because which function answers a question is exactly
-- the thing that differs between the two clients this addon ships for. A kind
-- this client has no setter for answers nil, and the caller draws whatever it
-- knew on its own.
--
-- **Nothing here is cached.** A scan happens when a tooltip opens, which is a
-- moment, and an item's text can change between two of those moments: a
-- requirement you now meet, a charge you have spent, a cooldown running. A
-- cache would buy a stale tooltip in exchange for nothing anybody can measure.

-- The scanner's name is load bearing. A GameTooltip's lines are reachable only
-- as globals built from the frame's own name, so a nameless one has text on it
-- that nothing can read.
local NAME = "WarriorKitTooltipScan"

-- What each kind asks the client, and how many arguments it passes.
--
-- The count is here rather than left to varargs so a caller that passes the
-- wrong number is refused rather than handed to the client, where the failure
-- is a Lua error inside a C function with no useful traceback. It costs one
-- comparison per hover.
--
-- `item` is a hyperlink, which is the shape everything in this addon carries an
-- item as: a loot row, a mail attachment and a chat link are all one string.
-- `inventory` is a worn slot number and is here for one caller, the weapon
-- enchant square on the buff row, because a temporary enchant answers to the
-- hand it is on rather than to an aura index.
--
-- `bag` is a bag number and a slot, and it is the same item as `item` asked
-- about from where it is lying rather than by name. A link carries no history:
-- the client reading one has no way to know whose bag it came out of, so it
-- says what the item does to whoever picks it up and writes "Binds when picked
-- up" over a sword that bound to you in a raid three months ago. Asked about
-- the slot it is in, the same client writes "Soulbound", because now it can see
-- that the binding already happened. Only a caller that knows the slot can ask
-- this way, which is the bags and nothing else: a loot row, a merchant shelf
-- and a link in chat are all items nobody has picked up yet, and on those the
-- warning is the truth.
--
-- `unit` is a token: player, target, mouseover, nameplate3. It is the only kind
-- here whose subject is not something this addon drew, and the one where the
-- client's text is the whole answer rather than a supplement to it. What the
-- game writes for a unit is the name, the level and classification tag, the
-- faction, the guild and on a player the class: five lines the addon has no
-- other way to word, half of them localised, and all of them already right.
--
-- `spell` is an id and is the only kind here whose subject is not on you and
-- not in a slot. Every other setter asks about a thing at a place: this action
-- slot, this aura index, this hand. A buff you are missing is at no place at
-- all, which is exactly the question the nag row has to ask, and the id is the
-- only handle there is on a spell nobody has cast.
--
-- SetSpellByID landed in Wrath. On the older client this kind answers nil like
-- any other question the client will not take, and the caller draws the name it
-- knew on its own.
--
-- `talent` is two values whose meaning moved: a tab and an index on every
-- client up to the anniversary build, and the talent's own id with a false
-- after it on that one. Talents/Read.lua asks both ways once and keeps the
-- one that wrote the talent's name on its first line, which is why this entry
-- says nothing about what the two values are.

-- The sentence an item's Use line is still waiting for
--
-- A book that teaches a profession says what it is for in one line: "Use:
-- Teaches you advanced first aid, allowing a maximum of 375 first aid skill."
-- That line is not the item's. It is the spell's own sentence printed on the
-- item, and the client does not hold every spell's text at all times. It
-- fetches one when something asks for it, and until it lands the line is not on
-- the tooltip at all.
--
-- Nothing above can see that. A scan is a moment, the tooltip that comes back
-- has the name, the level and the requirement on it, and the only line missing
-- is the one the item exists for. So the reader has to ask a second question,
-- and it is asked here rather than in UI/Tip.lua because it is the same
-- question the rest of this file asks: what is the client able to say about
-- this thing right now.
--
-- **Why it is a book and not a potion.** A spell you have cast, or that sits on
-- a bar, is already on the machine and its line is there on the first hover.
-- What is missing is the spell nothing has ever asked for, which is exactly the
-- one an unlearned book teaches. That is why this went unnoticed while every
-- trinket and every flask read correctly.
--
-- The three calls are Syndicator's, in Search/CheckItem.lua, and it makes all
-- three on this client rather than only on the newer one: the item's spell id,
-- whether its text is here, and the ask for one that is not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- and an ask for it where it is.
--
-- False for an item with no use effect at all, which is most of them, and false

-- Holding the client's own tooltip down
--
-- Every other hover in this addon is replaced by replacing the frame it lands
-- on. There is an OnEnter, the addon writes it, and Blizzard's tooltip is never
-- asked for. A creature in the world has no such frame: the cursor is over
-- WorldFrame, the client resolves `mouseover` and fills GameTooltip itself, and
-- there is nothing to overwrite. So the only way to have one box on screen
-- rather than two is to take the client's back down after it has gone up.
--
-- It is here because this is the file allowed to name GameTooltip, and that
-- rule is worth more than the convenience of putting the code beside the part
-- that asks for it. scripts/check.sh fails on the name anywhere else, comments
-- included.
--
-- **Narrow twice, and both narrowings are load bearing.** It is armed only
-- while the addon has a box of its own on screen, and it acts only on a tooltip
-- that answers a unit. GameTooltip is shared furniture: a quest reward, an item
-- somebody linked in chat, a bag slot, a merchant row and every other addon
-- installed all draw in it, and none of those is this addon's to take away.
--
-- What the two ways of being wrong cost is not the same, which is why the test
-- is the strict one rather than the thorough one.
--
--   too broad   a hover that is not a creature loses its tooltip whenever a mob
--               happens to be under the cursor as well. A linked item says
--               nothing, a quest reward says nothing, and nothing on screen
--               says why. That is a bug report nobody can reproduce.
--   too narrow  Blizzard's parchment stands beside the addon's box and the same
--               mob is described twice. Ugly for an evening, and nothing is
--               lost.
--
-- **The hook is never taken off.** HookScript chains under whatever the client
-- and every other addon already put there and there is no call to undo one, so
-- the flag below is what actually turns this on and off. Disarmed, the hook is
