-- Layout
--
-- A stack panel, in the sense XAML means it and CSS calls a flex container.
-- You describe what goes where and the file works out the offsets.
--
-- It exists because UnitFrames/EnemyBars.lua had a hundred and eighty lines
-- that did it by hand, and the hand-written version has the failure mode every
-- hand-written version has: each anchor is individually correct and the
-- relationship between them lives only in whoever wrote them. Moving the
-- threat line up by three pixels meant finding the four other offsets measured
-- from the same edge. Changing the icon row from four fixed squares to a list
-- that wraps meant re-deriving the widget's height from scratch.
--
--     Flow.Arrange(widget, {
--         direction = "column", reverse = true, gap = 4,
--         { frame = widget.box, height = 23, align = "stretch" },
--         { direction = "row", height = 16,
--             { frame = widget.threatText, grow = 1, align = "center" },
--             { direction = "row", wrap = true, justify = "end", ... },
--         },
--     })
--
-- Two passes, the same two XAML has. Measure asks every node how big it wants
-- to be, bottom up. Arrange hands every node the rectangle it actually got, top
-- down, and pins each frame to the root's top left corner at the offset that
-- came out. Pinning everything to one corner rather than chaining anchors is
-- deliberate: a chain can only align the run it starts, which is why the icon
-- row in the hand-written version had to be anchored square by square to the
-- gauge's corner with the row width subtracted.
--
-- Units. Everything here is in the units of the root frame, which for anything
-- ns.UI.Adopt has taken onto the grid means whole physical pixels. A caller
-- multiplies its design numbers by ns.UI.Unit once and hands them over. Offsets
-- are snapped through ns.UI.Round on the way out, because centring divides by
-- two and half of an odd number is half a pixel, which is what makes small
-- outlined text look like it has been breathed on.
--
-- What this does not do, and will not: content sizing. A node's size is a
-- number the caller knows before the layout runs. Two strings on an enemy bar
-- are sized by whatever the mob happens to be called, and they stay pinned to
-- each other with plain anchors, because a layout that had to re-run when a
-- name changed would be a layout running on the tick. The boundary is the same
-- one check.sh already enforces: nothing in here is reachable from an OnUpdate,
-- so this file is allowed to allocate and the files that call it are not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Node fields, all optional:
--
--   frame       the frame this node places and sizes
--   direction   "row", "column" or "stack"; having one makes the node a
--               container and its array part its children. A stack gives every
--               child the whole rectangle and lets each one place itself in it,
--               which is XAML's single-cell Grid and is how two things share a
--               strip of screen without either reserving room from the other
--   alignX      in a stack: "start", "center", "end" or "stretch"
--   alignY      the same, down
--   width       fixed size across, in root units; measured from children if
--   height      fixed size down; measured from children if absent
--   grow        share of whatever main-axis room is left over
--   gap         between children
--   pad         inside the container's own edges, a number or {l, t, r, b}
--   justify     along the main axis: "start", "center", "end", "between"
--   align       across it: "start", "center", "end", "stretch"
--   wrap        break a row onto more lines when it runs out of width
--   lineOrder   with wrap: "down" (default) or "up", which edge line one is on
--   reverse     run the main axis backwards, which is what mirroring is
--   flow        which way the content runs, said once. One word for the main
--               axis, "right" or "left" on a row and "down" or "up" on a
--               column, and on a wrapping row a second word, "down" or "up",
--               for which way its lines stack. "left up" is a row that fills
--               from the right edge and grows upward. It writes reverse,
--               justify and lineOrder, and it owns them: a caller that sets
--               flow does not set those three
--   skip        this node is not drawn and takes no room
--
-- A node is a plain table written at the call site. Nothing is kept between
-- calls and nothing is pooled: a layout runs on a setting change, a resolution
-- change or a rebuild, never on a ticker, and a pool would be a cache to
-- invalidate in exchange for tables nobody is counting.

local Measure

-- Turn a node's flow into the three fields the passes below read.
--
-- The three have to agree and nothing checked that they did. A row that runs
-- left is `reverse`, and reverse on its own puts a part filled line against
-- the wrong edge: the run still starts at x=0 and walks the children backwards
-- from there, so the short last line of a mirrored row hugged the far side
-- while the full lines hugged the near one. `justify = "end"` is what fixes
-- that, and it is the field the caller who wrote `reverse = true` forgot. Then
-- `lineOrder` says which edge line one is on, which is a third field about the
-- same question. A caller says the direction once and this writes all three.
--
-- Once per node. Measure is the first pass and every node goes through it, so
-- this runs before anything reads the fields it writes.
