--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A zone, drawn
--
-- The client's map art for one zone, at whatever size the caller gives it,
-- with a list of points on top and a wheel that zooms at the cursor. It is the
-- only file in the addon that reads the client's map art.
--
-- **It is in the kit because it has two callers.** It was Quests/Chart.lua,
-- built for the map behind the quest log's middle column, and its own header
-- said in its first paragraph that nothing in it knows what a quest is. The
-- world map is the second caller and it is a whole part rather than a page, so
-- the picture is a widget now: Map/Window.lua draws every zone in the game
-- with Questie's icons on it, Quests/Window.lua draws one zone with one
-- quest's places on it, and neither knows anything about the other.
--
-- **The picture is the client's own, in tiles.** A zone map is a single image
-- about a thousand pixels across, and the client does not store it that way: it
-- stores it cut into 256 pixel squares, twelve of them for a zone, and hands
-- over the list through C_Map. The last column and the last row are part
-- squares padded out to 256, so each one is drawn at its real width with the
-- padding cropped off by a texture coordinate. Draw all twelve at full size and
-- the map comes out with two seams of black through it, which is exactly what
-- it looked like before the crop was there.
--
-- **Every call into the client is probed and pcalled.** C_Map is not an addon's
-- to assume: this ships for two clients, one of them a build where half the
-- namespace was added later, and a window that raises because a map id has no
-- art is a window that has made the evening worse to save a rectangle. Every
-- path out of this file that cannot draw returns nothing and the caller writes
-- a line instead.
--
-- **The dots are pooled and the tiles are pooled.** This client cannot destroy
-- a frame or a texture, and the map is redrawn on every click in either
-- window's left column, so a map that built its own would leak twelve textures
-- and eighty frames per click. It is the same argument the quest log's two
-- scrolling columns make one file across.
--
-- **The wheel zooms, and it zooms at the cursor.** A zone drawn at the width of
-- one column is about three hundred pixels across a place that takes twenty
-- minutes to walk, which is enough to say which end of Westfall and not enough
-- to say which side of the road. So the picture is drawn inside a viewport it
-- is allowed to be bigger than, and the wheel makes it bigger. Six times is the
-- far end, which is where one of the client's 256 pixel tiles is drawn at twice
-- its own size and the art gives out.
--
-- The point under the cursor stays where it is, so one notch is a pan and a
-- zoom together. That was the whole of the navigation for a while, on the
-- argument that dragging means following the cursor and following the cursor
-- means an OnUpdate on a window that is open all evening. It is not enough. A
-- wheel notch pans towards whatever the pointer is already on, and at six times
-- the box is looking at a sixth of the zone: reading the road you have zoomed
-- in on means zooming out to find the next bit and back in again, which is the
-- gesture Blizzard's own map has never asked anybody for.
--
-- **So a drag on a zoomed picture pushes it under the box.** The tick that
-- follows the cursor lives for the length of the drag and is stopped on the
-- button coming up, which is the bargain UI/Placeable.lua already makes for the
-- other drag in the addon: an OnUpdate while a button is held is not a ticker
-- the addon has to defend, it is the gesture itself. Nothing is written unless
-- the offsets moved, and only the offsets move: the tiles, the fog and the
-- marks are placed on the canvas and the canvas is what slides.
--
-- **A click on the picture is answered by the client, not by this file.** The
-- caller hands over a function and gets back the map that was clicked and where
-- on it, as two fractions, and decides for itself what that means. It is the
-- only way the edges of a zone can be made to work: the client's zone art runs
-- over the border into whatever is next to it, and which strip of the picture
-- belongs to which neighbour is a table inside the client that only C_Map will
-- read. A caller that passes no function gets the drag and the wheel and
-- nothing on the button, which is what the quest log's map wants: it is a
-- picture of one quest rather than a place you can navigate from.
--
-- **A drag with nothing to push moves the window it is in.** A frame that
-- answers the mouse stops the frame under it from seeing the drag, and the
-- window this board sits in is dragged from anywhere on itself rather than
-- from a bar. So a drag the picture has no room for is handed up to whichever
-- frame above this one is movable, and a drag that moved either one is not
-- also a click. Which of the two happens is decided by the picture rather than
-- by a modifier: a zone that fits its box has nowhere to go and the window
-- moves, and a zoomed one is what you meant to drag.
--
-- **The viewport grows with the zoom and the box never outruns the picture.**
-- The caller says how wide the picture may be and how much height there is
-- going spare under it. At rest the box takes only the height the zone's own
-- shape asks for and leaves the rest empty; zoom in and it claims that space up
-- to the spare. So the wheel buys height as well as scale. The box is never
-- larger than the canvas inside it on either axis, which is what keeps the
-- picture off a scroll offset no client agrees about.
--
-- **A point is a coloured square or somebody else's icon.** A point carrying
-- `icon` is drawn as that texture, at its own size and with no wash and no
-- ring, because the art is already a mark somebody designed to be found on a
-- map. Both maps hand over Questie's own icons and both take the same route to
-- them: the world map reads them off Questie's frames, the quest log's map
-- resolves them out of the database through ns.QuestieIcon.
--
-- The square is what a point with no icon gets, and the kinds named below are
-- its palette. It is the fallback rather than the ordinary case now: no
-- Questie, no compiled database, or a version whose icon table moved is a map
-- drawn in colours rather than a map with nothing on it. The dungeon log's
-- numbered bosses are the one caller that means the square.
--
-- **A point may carry a unit, and one that does is taken again on the tick.**
-- Everything else on the picture is a fact about the zone: where a camp is, and
-- a camp does not walk. A person does, so the arrow and the party move ten
-- times a second while the board is up and the rest of the picture moves when
-- somebody asks for it. A point that names a unit the client will not place is
-- drawn nowhere rather than left off, which is what lets a mark come back on
-- when somebody walks into the zone with the map already open.
--
-- **The zone is drawn twice: dark, then the parts you have walked.** The tiles
-- above are the whole zone with nothing discovered on it, which is what the
-- client stores as the base art and is why a map drawn from tiles alone is the
-- map you had at level one for the whole game. What you have uncovered is a
-- second set of textures, one per area you have been into, and the client hands
-- them over through C_MapExplorationInfo with an offset and a size each. They
-- go over the tiles in the same layer at the next sublevel, at the same scale,
-- which is Blizzard's own arrangement on its own map. Nothing here decides what
-- you have seen; a zone you have not walked draws no pieces and stays dark,
-- which is the answer the player asked for.
--
-- **You are the client's arrow, and it turns.** A point of kind YOU is drawn as
-- Interface\WorldMap\WorldMapArrow rather than as a coloured square, rotated
-- to the direction you are facing, and it is the one mark on the board that is
-- taken again on a timer while the board is up. Everything else on the picture
-- is a fact about the zone and changes when somebody asks; where you are
-- standing changes because you walked, and a mark that only moved when the
-- window was repainted is a mark that is wrong most of the time it is on screen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What a point is for. Three strings, because a caller keys its own data on
-- them and Quests/Where.lua takes its three constants from these rather than
-- writing the words twice.

Chart.YOU  = "you"  -- where you are standing, which no database knows
Chart.MARK = "mark" -- a numbered place, which the dungeon log's bosses are
Chart.MATE = "mate" -- somebody else in your group, in their own class colour
Chart.DEAD = "dead" -- your corpse, which only the client knows the way back to

-- One dot, and the pale square behind it.
--
-- Five pixels was too few and it is worth writing down why. Zone art is a
-- painting of hills, roads and rivers in every colour a dot can be, and a five
-- pixel square with a one pixel border round it is a three pixel core: the same
-- size as the specks the texture is full of, and the same colours. The mark was
-- there and nobody could find it, which for the one thing the whole page exists
-- to say is the same as not drawing it.
--
-- So the dot is nine and it carries a wash of its own colour behind it. The
-- wash is what does the finding. A dot has to be looked for and a soft
-- seventeen pixel patch of blue on a green hillside does not, and where a camp
-- puts four dots inside one step the washes run together into one cloud, which
-- is the honest picture: not four things, one place with things in it.
local PIN, HALO = 9, 17

-- How big somebody else's icon is drawn. Bigger than the dot because it is a

-- smudge, and Questie draws its own at about this size on the client's map.
local BADGE = 14

-- Where you are standing, and which way you are pointing.
--
-- The texture and the size are the client's own, off its own map: Blizzard's
-- player pin is Interface\WorldMap\WorldMapArrow drawn at sixteen pixels, and
-- an arrow is the one mark on a map every player already knows how to read.
-- A gold square was here before and it said where you were standing without
-- saying which way you were facing, which is half of what you open a map for.
local ARROW, HEADING = "Interface\\WorldMap\\WorldMapArrow", 16

-- Where your corpse is, drawn as the client's own skull.
--
-- Blizzard's parity again, and this time it is a cell rather than a file: its
-- own map draws the corpse out of Interface\Minimap\POIIcons, the last eighth
-- of the top row of the sheet, at twenty four pixels scaled to eight tenths.
-- Same sheet, same cell, same nineteen pixels here. A skull is the mark every
-- player has run towards since the first client and nothing this addon could
-- draw instead would be read faster.

local CELL = { 0.875, 1, 0, 0.125 }

-- How often the arrow is taken again while the board is up.
--
-- Blizzard's own map pin does this on every frame. A tenth of a second is
-- under what anybody can see a mark jump at and is a fortieth of the work, and
-- it moves one texture and turns it: the picture, the tiles and every other
-- mark are still drawn only when somebody asks for them.
local FOLLOW = 0.1

-- How much of the wash is there. Enough to lift the dot off the art and not
-- enough to hide what is under it, because the road beside the camp is half of
-- why you are looking at a map at all.
local MIST = 0.3

-- How far in the wheel will take the zone, and what one notch of it is worth.
--
-- Six is where a 256 pixel tile of the client's own art is drawn at about twice
-- its size, which is the point past which zooming buys blur rather than detail.
-- The notch is a third bigger each time, so five notches cross the whole range
-- and no single one of them loses you.
local DEEPEST, NOTCH = 6, 1.3

-- The most tiles one zone is allowed to be cut into. Every zone on these
-- clients is 1002 by 668 in squares of 256, which is four across and three
-- down; the cap is what stops a map this addon has never seen from making
-- textures until the frame runs out.
local TILES = 24

-- The most pieces of uncovered ground one zone is allowed. A piece is one area
-- you have walked into, cut into tiles the same way the base art is, and the
-- busiest zone in the game is well under a hundred of them. Same bargain as the
-- cap above: a map this file has never seen draws part of itself rather than
-- making textures until the frame runs out.
local SEEN = 256

-- What each kind of place is drawn in. Blue for what is left to do, because
-- blue is the colour a control is drawn in and a place on a map is a thing to
-- go and press. Green for the hand-in, which is the same green a finished quest
-- is in down the left column. You are not in the table: you are the client's
-- own arrow rather than a colour, which is the one mark on the map that is not

-- second would be paying a zone's worth of work for one texture that moved a
-- pixel.
--
-- Nothing is written unless something moved. The tick runs whether you are
-- walking or reading, and by far the most common answer is that you are in the
-- same spot facing the same way: an anchor set again costs a measure and a
-- relayout, and a comparison costs a comparison. Turning is guarded one layer
-- down, in Aim, because you can turn on the spot without moving.
--
-- The caller's own point is updated as well as the pin, because the hover under
-- the arrow says the coordinate and a coordinate from where you were standing
-- when the window opened is a wrong answer that reads as a right one.
--
-- The arrow goes off the board on a zone you are not in, and it goes without a
-- repaint: cross the border with Westfall up and the mark leaves with you
-- rather than staying at the crossing.
--
-- A local rather than the method below, because scripts/check.sh names the
-- functions an OnUpdate can reach and it names them by their declaration. What
-- is on that list is held to no unguarded widget write and no allocation, which
-- is the rule this whole function is shaped by.
--
-- Every point carrying a unit is taken again, not only you. A mark for a person
-- is the one kind on this board whose place is a fact about right now: the
-- others are where a camp is, and a camp does not walk. So the arrow and the
-- party move on the tick and the rest of the picture moves when somebody asks.
--
-- One question to the client per person per tick, which in a full raid with
-- this window open is forty of them a second. That is what Blizzard's own map
-- spends on the same picture, it is spent only while the window is up, and the
-- alternative is a party that stands still until something repaints.
