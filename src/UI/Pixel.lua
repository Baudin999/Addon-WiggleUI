-- The pixel grid
--
-- The client draws the whole interface in a virtual space 768 units tall,
-- whatever the monitor is. A frame of height H at effective scale S covers
--
--     H * S * physicalHeight / 768
--
-- physical pixels, so one pixel is 768 / (S * physicalHeight) units. On a
-- screen 768 pixels tall that collapses to 1 / S, which is what this addon
-- returned from ns.Pixel until now. On this machine, 1440 tall with the UI
-- scale at 0.65, the true figure is 0.82 units and the old one was 1.54: every
-- hairline in the addon was being asked for at 1.9 pixels, which the renderer
-- lays down as a two pixel smear along one edge of a box and a one pixel line
-- along the other. That is the whole reason nothing looked crisp.
--
-- Correcting the arithmetic is not enough on its own, because a correct
-- fractional number of units still lands wherever the frame's own origin
-- happens to sit. The fix is to stop working in fractions. SetIgnoreParentScale
-- detaches a frame from whatever scale its parent carries, and a scale of
-- 768 / physicalHeight then makes one unit exactly one physical pixel inside
-- that frame and everything under it. Sizes become whole numbers of pixels
-- written as whole numbers, there is no rounding anywhere, and no arithmetic
-- runs on a ticker to keep it true.
--
-- What this cannot fix: a bar attached to a nameplate takes its origin from
-- where the mob is standing, which is a moving sub-pixel position no addon can
-- read or round. Its geometry is exact and its edges are one pixel; where that
-- pixel lands is the client's business. Bars in the list anchor to UIParent and
-- are exact in both.

-- many units is one physical pixel", which on the grid is 1/zoom. A design that
-- multiplies every one of its own numbers by that has divided itself by the
-- zoom, and the scale the zoom put on the frame multiplies it straight back. The
-- widget comes out the same physical size at zoom 1, 2 and 3, and the setting is
-- inert. That is exactly what the enemy bars did.
--
-- A design pixel is not a physical pixel. On the grid one design pixel is one
-- unit, and the zoom is what turns that unit into a 1x1, 2x2 or 3x3 block of
-- screen pixels, which is the entire point of having a zoom. Off the grid, on a
-- client with no SetIgnoreParentScale, there is no zoom and no block to make, so
-- the honest conversion is the fractional one and UI.Pixel is already it.
--
-- The rule for a caller: UI.Pixel for a hairline, an inset or anything else that
-- means one screen pixel and should stay one screen pixel when the design grows.
