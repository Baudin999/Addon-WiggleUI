-- The tooltip
--
-- Every hover in this addon went to the client's own tooltip until this
-- existed, and that was always the wrong box for it. Blizzard's is a
-- parchment: a tiled background asset, a gold border drawn from a corner sheet, Friz
-- Quadrata at whatever size the client's own tooltip scale says, and a shape
-- this addon has spent its whole life replacing everywhere else. A window with
-- a one pixel edge and a flat sans on it that raises a parchment scroll when
-- you hover a row is a window with two designs in it.
--
-- So this is the addon's own. Same palette, same metrics, same font cache,
-- same pixel grid. Nothing in it is a template and nothing in it is an asset.
--
-- **One tooltip, not one per owner.** A hover puts up one box, so there is one
-- frame with a pool of lines in it, refilled on every open. A tooltip per
-- hoverable row would be a frame and a dozen font strings per row in a feed
-- that holds four hundred of them.
--
-- A gear comparison is the one hover that needs more than one box, and it is
-- still not one per owner: it is a small pool of the same box, hung off the
-- side of the first, built by the same code and filled from the same data
-- shape. That is why a box is a value in this file rather than a set of
-- locals. See NewBox, and see `alongside` on Tooltip.Show.
--
-- **It is one size, and that size is the addon's.** Every box this file draws
-- comes out at the size the hover setting asks for, whatever it was opened on.
--
-- It used to take the owner's zoom instead, on the argument that a box six
-- hundred pixels across cannot explain a row thirty pixels tall. What that
-- bought in practice was a tooltip whose text changed size as the cursor
-- crossed the screen. The missing buff row ships at 2x, because four squares
-- over your character have to be readable from across a fight, and a square on
-- it opened a box in text twice the size of the one the action bar under it
-- opened. Neither box was wrong about its owner. The pair of them was wrong
-- about the addon, which has one body size and one heading size and had been
-- drawing both at whatever scale the widget under the cursor happened to want.
--
-- A tooltip is not part of the thing you hovered. It is a paragraph about it,
-- and how big the addon's paragraphs are is the size slider's answer, the same
-- answer every window here takes. So the size of a HUD widget is now about how
-- far away you read it from, and the size of text is one setting.
--
-- **It sits where the client's own tooltip sits.** The bottom right corner,
-- clear of the bags and of whatever action bars are switched on, read off the
-- client's own two clearances rather than written down here. A box that opens
-- beside the row under the cursor is a box covering the next row, and every
-- hover in this addon is over the middle of the screen where the fighting is.
-- Beside is still there behind a switch, because on a very wide screen the
-- corner is a long way from what you are reading.
--
-- **A caller hands over data, not a run of calls.** See the schema below. The
-- imperative writers this file used to publish are still here as locals and
-- are no longer a surface: five ways to write a line is five things a caller
-- can do in the wrong order, and the one that mattered, whether a title had
-- been written, was bookkeeping every caller had to get right.
--
-- **It draws, and it decides nothing.** What a tooltip says about the thing you
-- hovered is UI/Tip.lua's, and the client's own text for that thing is
-- UI/Scan.lua's. This file takes the finished description and puts it on the
-- screen. Three files rather than one because they change for different
-- reasons: the box changes when the theme does, the registry changes when a
-- part has something new to say, and the scanner changes when a client does.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

local FRAME_NAME = "WiggleUITooltip"

-- Every number here is a unit, which is one physical pixel inside a frame
-- ns.UI.Adopt has taken onto the grid, and a whole block of them above zoom 1.
--
-- These were half as generous again and it showed. A tooltip is not a dialog:
-- it is a label that follows the cursor, it is read in the half second before
-- you move on, and every unit of air in it is a unit of the game it is
-- covering. The wrap width is the number that does the most work, because it
-- alone decides the shape of the box: it holds about forty characters, which is
-- a sentence you take in without tracking back to the left edge and is narrower
-- than every item name in the game bar a few.
--
-- Forty characters is the number, not the pixels. 210 bought forty of Arial
-- Narrow at twelve; the face is Noto Sans now and 210 buys thirty six, so a box
-- kept at 210 answers a question about air with a different sentence shape than
-- the one the paragraph above argues for. 266 buys the forty back. It is more
-- of the fight covered and that is the trade this whole comment is about.
local PAD = 6       -- the edge to the first glyph
local GAP = 2       -- one line to the next
local COLUMN = 16   -- the least air between a label and its value
local RULE = 3      -- the air either side of the hairline under a title
local SPACER = 4    -- a blank line, which is air rather than an empty line
local MAX = 266     -- the widest a line is drawn before it wraps
local OFFSET = 4    -- the owner to the tooltip
-- The pointer's hotspot to the tooltip, which is a different number from the
-- one above and has to be. A frame has an edge to open clear of; a cursor has
-- art that hangs down and to the right of the hotspot, so a box four units off
-- the hotspot opens underneath the arrow that opened it.
local POINTER = 20
local INSET = 3     -- a bar's edge to the text drawn on it

-- Where the client parks its own tooltip when nothing has anchored it: the
-- bottom right corner of the screen, held clear of the bags and of however many
-- rows of action bar are switched on. The client keeps that clearance in two
-- globals it rewrites whenever the bags open or a bar appears, and its own
-- default anchor puts thirteen more units between the box and the right edge.
-- Reading them is what "where the client has it" means. A pair of numbers
-- written here would be that corner on one layout and the wrong corner on the
-- next.
local DOCK = 13
-- What those two are before anything has moved them, for a client that defines
-- neither. The bare corner and one bag bar, which is the layout every value the
-- client writes into them is a variation on.
local DOCK_X, DOCK_Y = 0, 70

-- Two sizes and no more. A title that is the body size is not a title, and a
-- third size in a box this small is a typeface competition.
--
-- Both come off UI.Metric rather than being written here. They were 13 and 11,
-- and the 11 was the mistake: it is UI.Metric.small, the size the panel keeps
-- for a hint under a control, and a tooltip is not a footnote. Every line of a
-- tooltip is the thing you opened it to read, so its body is the addon's body
-- size and the panel it hangs over no longer has larger text than the box
-- describing it.
--
-- One pixel now separates the title from the body, which on its own would not
-- be a title. It does not carry that on its own: the title is the heading gold
-- against C.text below it, and it has a hairline under it that no other line
-- gets.
--
-- **And both of them move together.** How big a tooltip reads is a preference
-- the same way the zoom under it is one, and for the same reason: a box you read in
-- the half second before you move on is a box whose text you should not be
-- leaning in for. So the body is a number the player sets and the title is that
-- number plus the one pixel that separates them, which keeps the pair a pair at
-- every size. The zoom is not the answer to this question. It scales the whole
-- box, air and all, and a tooltip that grew its padding to buy a readable
-- sentence would cover twice as much of the fight.
local TITLE_LEAD = M.heading - M.font

-- The floor and the ceiling on that number, and the two sizes as they stand.
--
-- Eight is where the face stops resolving its own counters and eighteen is
-- where a five line box is a quarter of the screen. Neither end is a size
-- anybody should want; they are there so a saved variable edited by hand cannot
-- draw a tooltip nobody can read or one nobody can see past.

-- The cursor, handed to Show in place of an owner.
--
-- Everything else this box opens on is a frame: a feed row, a nag square, an
-- action slot, a filter chip. A creature in the 3D world is not one. There is
-- no OnEnter, nothing to hang an anchor off and nothing to take a zoom from, so
-- the box follows the pointer the way the client's own tooltip does.
--
-- A table rather than a string because an owner is compared with == and asked
-- for its anchor, and a table nobody else holds cannot collide with a frame or
-- be produced by accident at a call site that meant something else.
Tooltip.CURSOR = {}

-- One box, as a value.
--
-- **The frame and everything measured on it used to be file locals**, because
-- there was one box and a second one was not a thing that could happen. Gear
-- comparison is that thing: shift held over an item puts what you are wearing
-- beside what you are pointing at, and a ring is two boxes rather than one.
--
-- So a box is a table now and every function below takes one. Nothing else
-- changed and that is the point of doing it this way: the box beside the box is
-- drawn by the same code, in the same chrome, off the same data shape, and
-- there is no second implementation to keep in step with the first.

--   count, widest, titled what the last open put in it
--   zoom                  the size that open drew at, per box because a box

--

-- **A tooltip that vanishes on the frame you leave the row is a tooltip you

-- box itself is not hoverable: a sentence that names a number you wanted to
-- read twice is gone the moment you move to look at something beside it.
--
-- So leaving a thing starts a countdown rather than closing the box, and the
-- countdown is the player's number. Hovering anything else cancels it outright
-- and draws the new box on the spot, because the one thing a linger must never
-- do is make the next hover wait for the last one.
--
-- **And the number ships at nought.** The countdown was the default for a
-- while and the argument above is the argument for it. The argument against it
-- is what the client's own tooltip has always done, and it won: a box that
-- outlives the hover by a second is a box over the row under the pointer on

--          none.

--   { "a sentence", color = C.dim }  the same, in a colour of its own

--   { blank = true }                 air between two groups
--
-- Data rather than a run of calls because a tooltip is a description of one

-- to know that Title comes first, that Blank is a line, and that writing
-- nothing means drawing nothing; all three of those are this file's business

-- Almost nothing writes this table by hand any more. UI/Tip.lua builds it from

--
-- Which quarter is decided against the middle of UIParent as UIParent itself

-- are the same number only where the screen's own origin is its bottom left

-- the grid sit at a scale of their own, and a comparison that skipped the

-- width of a row: the cursor is somewhere in the middle of a wide thing and the
-- box opens clear of it. It is wrong for anything small. The cursor's hotspot
-- is the pointer's top left corner and the arrow hangs down and to the right
-- from there, so a box pinned to the top right of a sixteen pixel square opens
-- underneath the arrow that opened it and you read it round the pointer. That
