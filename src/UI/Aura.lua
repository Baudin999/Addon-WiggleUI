--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- One aura, drawn
--
-- A square with a cropped icon in it, a hairline round the icon, a sweep over
-- the art that empties as the aura runs out, the time left over the top of it
-- and the stack count in the corner. Whoever cast it is the fifth thing it
-- says, and it says it by draining the art rather than by adding a colour:
-- yours in full colour, someone else's grey.
--
-- Two rows in this addon draw one of these. The debuff row on an enemy bar
-- draws a fixed list of spells you asked it to watch, lit when the mob has one
-- and dimmed when it does not. The row under the skinned target block draws
-- whatever is actually on the target, however many that is. Those two ticks
-- have nothing in common and both were writing the same four guarded writes,
-- which is what this file is instead.
--
-- It is not UI/Ability.lua and it does not want to be. That file's whole
-- vocabulary is ten reasons a press does or does not land, and it hangs the
-- countdown text off `status == "cooldown"` because below the global there is
-- nothing worth counting. An aura is not a press. It has no cost, no range and
-- no stance, its timer is the thing you actually read, and the six extra
-- textures a button needs for its pushed state, its equipped ring and its
-- armed ring are six textures per square nobody will ever see. The one thing
-- the two files do share is the client's Cooldown frame, because there is one
-- widget in the game that draws a wedge and this is it.
--
-- Three calls, split by when they run, which is the split UI/Gauge.lua and
-- UI/Ability.lua both use.
--
--   Aura.New    allocates. Once per square.
--   Aura.Size   lays the square out. On a settings change or a rescale.
--   Aura.Draw   runs on a ticker against every square on the screen, so it
--               allocates nothing and writes nothing already on the widget.
--               check.sh's HOT list holds it to that.

-- What the number is written in, and it is the client's own rule rather than
-- one of ours. The client's buff frame has read a duration in gold and a
-- countdown in white for twenty years: over a minute it is written in minutes
-- and is gold, under a minute it is written in seconds and is white. So the
-- colour and the unit are the same fact said twice, which is why Tint below
-- takes the unit and not the seconds.
--
-- This replaced an amber-under-ten, red-under-five ladder of our own. The
-- ladder was not wrong about what is urgent; it was wrong about who decides.
-- Half the auras on your screen are drawn by the client, in a row above this
-- one, and two rows that disagree about what a colour means are two rows you
-- have to read separately.
local TIMER_TEXT = Color.text.name
local DURATION_TEXT = Color.text.duration

-- What the sweep is made of. Black, because it is a shadow over the art rather
-- than a colour of its own, and at two thirds so the icon under it is still
-- identifiable at the moment it matters most, which is the moment it is nearly
-- covered.
local SWIPE = { 0, 0, 0, 0.65 }

local MINUTE, HOUR = 60, 3600

-- Both numbers are sized off the square rather than off whatever is beside it,
-- because the square is a setting in both callers: a fourteen pixel timer on a
-- sixteen pixel icon covers the art it is annotating. The caller's own ceiling
-- comes in as an argument, so a row of squares cannot carry type larger than
-- the rest of the widget it sits on.
--
-- Both go through UI.NumberFont and come back flat with a shadow, which is the
-- whole reason a seven pixel stack count is readable: nothing is spent on a
-- rim. The count has the icon's own art behind it, which is what a shadow is
-- for. The timer has the world, and it keeps the shadow anyway, because it is
-- eight to fourteen pixels tall and an outline at that size closes the hole in
-- a 6. UI/Text.lua's floor is the reason that trade is written down here.
--
-- The timer's share is under half the square because the string is now up to
-- four characters wide rather than up to two. At six tenths, "28 m" was wider
-- than the square it stands over, and a strip that overhangs on both sides is
-- what makes two squares beside each other read as one number.
local TIMER_SHARE, TIMER_FLOOR = 0.45, 8
local COUNT_SHARE, COUNT_FLOOR = 0.5, 7

-- Three states and not eight. Nobody has it, someone else has it, you have it.
-- Everything the square says about who cast it is in this table and in one
-- SetDesaturated, so the two callers cannot drift into disagreeing about what
-- a debuff of yours looks like.
--
-- "none" is only reachable from the enemy bars, where a slot stands for a
-- spell you asked to watch and the mob may not have it. The target row never
-- draws a square for an aura that is not there.
local ALPHA = { mine = 1, theirs = 0.65, none = 0.22 }

-- What the strip over the square reads, as a number and the unit it is in.
--
-- It used to be the seconds, whole, whatever the number was, which is what put
-- 1972 across a sixteen pixel square. Four digits of a half hour buff are a
-- precision nobody reads and they cover the art that says which buff it is.
-- The client's own frames have read "28 m" for twenty years and they are
-- right, so this answers in the largest unit that still says something true.
--
-- The unit is written out, seconds included, and with the space the client
-- puts there. "56 s" and "14 m" are what the row above ours says, and a row
-- that dropped the s would be the one row on the screen where a bare 56 could
-- be either.
--
-- Rounded up, in every unit. A buff reading 1 m has at least a minute left in
-- it, and a number that reaches 0 while the aura is still on the unit is a
-- number lying about the thing it is written on.
--
-- The two returns are what the caller guards on, so the string behind them is
-- built when the reading moves and not five times a second: above a minute
-- that is once a minute per square, and above an hour once an hour.

	-- on top of each other.
	--
	-- Reversed, which is the whole difference between a cooldown and an aura.

	-- number, and the shadow behind it only ever fixes one of them. Over the

	-- and a better one in practice, because a number nothing else is competing
	-- with is a number you read at a glance.
	--
