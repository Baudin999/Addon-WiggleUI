-- Windows, rails and tab strips
--
-- The chrome, and the two pieces of navigation that go in it. A window is a
-- titled, draggable, escape-closing rectangle with a content area and a footer.
-- A rail is a column of choices down the left. A tab strip is a row of choices
-- across the top of whatever the rail chose.
--
-- All three are here rather than in the options panel because none of them
-- knows what a setting is, and the next window this addon grows, an aura list,
-- a loot log, a profile browser, wants the same three and should not be
-- copying them out of a file called Panel.lua.
--
-- **A window is adopted onto the pixel grid.** It is a frame the addon owns
-- outright, anchored to UIParent, so unlike a nameplate it can be exact in both
-- size and position, and every number in UI.Metric is then a count of physical
-- pixels. The cost is the cost the enemy bars already pay: a window 540 pixels
-- wide is 540 pixels on a laptop and 540 on a 4K panel, which on the 4K panel
-- is small. Zoom is the answer there, and it comes from two places that
-- multiply: UI.ScreenZoom, a whole step the screen height picks on its own, and
-- UI.Size, the slider the player drags in the settings panel. A screen that
-- doubles everything and a player who halves it land back on the design size,
-- which is the arithmetic you want and the reason they are one number by the
-- time a window sees them.
--
-- **The size is deliberate and the window does not resize.** The old panel grew
-- to whatever its tallest page needed, which on this screen was 773 physical
-- pixels of a 1440 pixel monitor for a settings window, and then scaled itself
-- down when that overflowed, which shrank the text to buy room for settings
-- nobody was reading. This one is a fixed rectangle: a section that does not fit
-- scrolls. A drag handle to resize it would mean a saved size, a minimum, a
-- maximum, and a reflow of every section on every mouse move, to buy what the
-- scrollbar already gives.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Every window the library has made, in creation order. Nothing in the addon
-- reads it yet. It exists because a UI layer that means to own the screen has
-- to be able to answer "what is open", and because the harness drives the
-- options panel through it rather than through a hook cut into the panel for
-- the harness's benefit.
UI.Windows = {}

-- What the screen asks for, before the player has said anything. Whole steps
-- only: below a 1600 pixel tall screen the pixel metrics are already
-- comfortable, above 2000 they are half the size they should be, and a
-- fractional step chosen on the player's behalf would put every edge in the
-- window onto a half pixel to buy a size nobody asked for.

-- to no feature and so have nobody to ask: the confirm box in UI/Ask.lua and,
-- through its own setter, the hover box.
--
-- The number is held here rather than read out of ns.db, because this layer is
-- not allowed to know the name of a setting. Settings/Settings.lua reads the
-- saved value and pushes it in, the same way a widget takes a getter rather than a key.
--
-- The screen's step and the player's multiply. On a 4K panel the screen has
-- already doubled everything, so half size lands back on the design size and is
-- exact; on a 1080p panel the screen contributes 1 and half size is genuinely
-- half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The dark behind a screen window
--
-- A screen window has no ground, so what it is written on is the game. Narcissus
-- dims the screen either side of its figure and it is the whole reason that page
-- reads as one thing rather than as text scattered over scenery. This is that,
-- for the half of the monitor a screen window takes: one wash, solid at the
-- outer edge and gone by the middle where the player's character is standing.
--
-- It stops at the window's own edge, which is what the two anchors below are
-- for. Half the monitor is the half the sheet was cut down to so the player
-- keeps the other half to fight in, and a shadow that crept past the frame
-- would be taking back the thing that cut was made to give.
--
-- **It never answers the pointer.** This is the one piece of chrome in the
-- addon that could cost the player the world behind it and do it silently. A
-- screen window turns the mouse off on its own frame precisely so a click on
-- the sheet reaches the mob behind it, and a wash laid over half the monitor on
-- a frame that took the mouse would be half a monitor you can no longer target,
-- loot or turn the camera in. It draws the same either way and hovers the same
-- either way, so nothing about looking at it says which one shipped. So it is a
-- texture on the window's own frame rather than a frame of its own: there is no
-- new surface for anyone to switch the mouse on later, and the pointer harness
-- presses a point on the sheet's half and reads back nothing.
--
-- **Faded rather than shown.** A rectangle of shadow over half the screen that
-- appears between one frame and the next on a key press is the one thing on
-- this page that reads as a bug rather than as an interface.

-- The wash, and the one script that catches every way a screen window comes up.
--
-- OnShow rather than Window:Show, and that is the whole reason this is a script
-- at all. The character sheet is opened in a fight by a secure snippet, which
-- runs none of this file's Lua, so a fade hung off the method would be a fade
-- that never happened on the key most people open the sheet with.
--
-- Set rather than hooked, because a window is this library's frame and the
-- caller is the one chaining onto it. Character/Window.lua hooks its own paint
-- under this, the way Mail/Window.lua already hooks OnHide.

-- sheet is up, the unit blocks go away by snippet because they cannot come into
-- that room, so the page is read against scenery and nothing else.
--
-- Its own function beside Darkness rather than four more lines inside it. They
-- are two answers to the same question and the caller switches them separately:
-- a player who wants to watch the world behind the sheet turns the wash off and
-- still wants the cooldown row out of the middle of his gear.
--
-- Hooked rather than set, because Darkness set OnShow one line above and
-- Dismissals set OnHide before either of them ran. Both are this library's own
-- scripts on this library's own frame, and chaining is what stops the second

--
-- A listening key field has the keyboard and an open dropdown covers whatever is
-- under it, so a click anywhere else in the window has to be a way out of both.
-- Each of them eats its own click, so this never cancels the click that opened
-- it.
--

-- rather than off the Hide method, and every route out goes through it.

-- Where the window sits among everything else on screen.
--
-- DIALOG unless the caller says otherwise. A settings window is something you
-- open over the game and close again, and DIALOG is where that belongs. A
-- window that is up while you play, which is what the chat window is, has to
-- sit under the tooltip and under anything the client puts over the world, so
-- it asks for a lower one.
--
-- One strata is one pile. Every window in the addon is in the same one, and
-- two frames at the same level in the same pile are sorted by their children:
-- the second window's title bar draws over the first window's body and under
-- the first window's buttons. Toplevel is the client's answer. A toplevel
-- frame is lifted above every sibling in its strata when it is clicked,
-- children and all, so a window is over or under another window entirely and
-- never threaded through it. Window:Show does the same lift, because the
-- window you just opened is the one you want on top and a click is not what
-- opened it.
--
-- A screen window is never lifted and stays under every window the player
-- opens, which is what SetToplevel(false) buys: a sheet that jumped a strata on
-- a click would put itself over the bags the moment you clicked a gear square.
--
-- It is not the floor any more, and BACKGROUND is what it used to be. A screen
-- window has no ground, so the pile it was at the bottom of was the whole
-- screen: every rectangle this addon draws over the world sits at MEDIUM or
-- HIGH, so did the client's, and all of them drew over the page. HIGH is above
-- the HUD and below DIALOG, which is the two facts a screen window needs to be
-- true at once. UI/Hush.lua is the other half of the same answer and shuts the
-- addon's own rows away while the sheet is up; this is what covers everything
-- neither file owns.

-- Where a window can be dragged to, and whether it can be dragged at all.
--
-- Dragged through UI/Placeable.lua, which owns placing for every frame in the
-- addon that can be moved, windows included. Its header says why that is one
-- file and not two. No name, because a window has a bar across its top to grab
-- it by and answers the mouse whether or not you are placing it. /wk lock does
-- not reach a window unless the window asks it to, which the chat window is the
-- only one to do. Locking a quest log would be locking a window rather than
-- placing the HUD.
--
-- A screen window is dragged by its background: every pixel of it the page has
-- not put something on.
--
-- It had no drag at all while it was the whole monitor, which was right then: a
-- frame the size of the screen is already where it goes. It is half the screen
-- now, and half a screen is a thing a player has an opinion about, so the drag
-- is back.
--
-- The first answer was a strip along the top, twenty four pixels of title bar in
-- everything but the paint, kept narrow because a drag target the size of a wall
-- takes the left button and the camera's right drag out of half the game. That
-- is a real cost and the strip is still worse: a handle you cannot see, on a
-- window with no chrome to say where it is, and the player has to find it before
-- the sheet moves at all.
--
-- So the grip is the whole window and it sits under the page instead of over it.
-- Under is what makes it safe to be that big. Everything the page draws that
-- answers the mouse wins the click: the nineteen gear squares still use what is
-- in them, the figure still turns under the left drag and zooms under the wheel,
-- and the readings still hover. What is left is background, and background is
-- the handle. The one thing the sheet gives up is the world behind it, which it
-- used to hand every click it did not want; while the sheet is up, a click on it
-- moves the sheet rather than reaching the mob. This client has no
-- SetPassThroughButtons to split that, and UI/Press.lua carries why.
--
-- Nothing is drawn for it. The strip that used to light under the cursor was
-- there to point at a handle you could not otherwise find; a handle that is the
-- whole window has nothing to point at, and a bar along the top would now be
-- saying the drag lives up there when it lives everywhere. The sheet is a page
-- drawn on the world and it keeps no chrome it does not need.

-- of what a window is, and the argument for the shape it has is a paragraph

-- carry it off the edge entirely, and leaves the player with no part of the
-- game left to click on. The page was right and the canvas was wrong.
--
-- Then it was half the monitor across at four by three, and that was the same

-- The rail
--

-- stands open with its sections listed under it, indented. Choosing a section
-- is one click on the thing you came for rather than a click on the rail and a
-- second one on a strip of tabs across the top of the page.
--
-- The strip was the thing this replaced and it had two faults a fold does not.
-- It could only show the sections of the group you were already on, so the
-- window never showed more than an eighth of itself at once. And a group with
-- eleven of them wrapped onto three lines of stubs, which took a fifth of the
-- page's height to say what a column says in a column.
--
-- One group is open at a time. Clicking a shut one opens it onto whichever
-- section you were last reading there; clicking the open one shuts it, and the
-- page stays up with the group's own row carrying the mark instead. So the rail
-- can be folded flat to eight lines without the window going blank.
--
-- It sits in a scroll view of its own, because open is taller than shut: eight
-- groups fit the rail with room over, and eight plus the eleven sections of
-- Fighting do not. Reveal keeps whatever is selected inside the viewport, so
-- opening a long group never scrolls the chosen row off the bottom.

-- The tab strip
--
-- A row of choices across the top of a window or a page, one per thing behind
-- it. The options window used to navigate with one and now folds its rail
-- instead; what is left are the two places a strip is the right shape: the chat
-- window's channels, and the list of loadouts inside one page of the panel.
-- Both are short, both are one word each, and neither is the top level of
-- anything.
--
-- Each tab is as wide as its own title, because a title is what a tab is for
-- and cutting it in half to make the row tidy loses the only information on it.
-- A row that runs out of width wraps onto the next one and the strip grows by a
-- whole tab, so eight of them is a taller strip rather than eight unreadable
-- stubs.
--
-- **A bare strip is the same row with its chrome taken off**: no fill behind a
-- tab, no line under the row, just the words and the accent bar under the one
-- you are on. It is for the character sheet, which is a backdrop the size of
-- the screen rather than a window, and where a strip of filled buttons over the
-- world is the one thing on the page that still looks like a dialog. What a tab
-- is stays exactly what it was: the colours already carry selected, hovered and
-- unread on their own, and the fill was never the thing saying which was which.

-- The side strip
--
-- The same idea as the strip above, turned a quarter turn: a column of tabs
-- down the edge of something, each one's label rotated so the strip is only as
-- wide as a line of text is tall. It is for a thing standing over the world
-- rather than inside a window, where a row of tabs across the top would cost
-- the whole width of the thing and a rail down the side would cost a third of
-- it. The quest tracker is what asked, and one zone name per tab down its left
-- edge costs it fifteen pixels.
--
-- **Two differences from the strip, and both are about what changes.** A strip
-- is built once with the tabs a window has: two on the quest log, one per room
-- in the chat window's loadouts. The zones you have quests in change every time
-- you accept or hand one in, so this takes a list on every paint and pools the
-- buttons, the way UI.List does and for the same reason: a frame cannot be
-- destroyed on this client, so a strip that rebuilt would leak a button per
-- quest handed in.
--
-- And a tab here is keyed rather than numbered. An index into a list of zones
-- is a position that moves the moment a zone empties, which is the same
-- argument Quests/Log.lua makes about quest ids: the caller says "Westfall" and
-- gets Westfall whatever the log did since.
--
-- **The turn is real and it is probed.** FontString:SetRotation is on both of
-- the clients this addon ships for: it is in SimpleFontStringAPIDocumentation
-- .lua on the anniversary branch and on classic_era. It is still asked for by
-- name and pcalled, because every client call in this addon is, and a client
-- that will not turn a label gets the labels upright: the strip is then as wide
-- as its widest word, which is worse and is still readable, rather than a
-- column of tabs with nothing written on them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The air round a rotated label, along the strip and across it. The same two
-- numbers TABPAD is for the strip above, and they are not one number here: a
-- tab is a long thin rectangle and the air at its ends reads differently from
-- the air at its sides.
--
-- Six across rather than four, because four was the air a tab had on paper and
-- not the air it had on the screen: the width was taken off the font's asked
-- size, a line of text is taller than the size it is asked for, and the label
-- ate both edges and sat against one of them. The measurement below is the fix
-- and this is the air that fix makes visible.

-- The list
--
-- A column of rows down the left of a window, where the rows change while the
-- window is open. That is the whole difference between this and the rail above
-- it, and it is why there are two of them rather than one with a flag.
--
-- The rail is the options window's: forty five sections that are known at load,
-- built once, folded and unfolded. The list is the chat window's: a room per
-- conversation, and the set of conversations changes every time you join a
-- party, leave a guild, or get a whisper from somebody you have never spoken to.
-- Folding is not the question there. What is drawn at all is.
--
-- So a caller hands over the rows it wants and gets them, and this file works
-- out which frames to reuse. A frame cannot be destroyed on this client, so
-- rows are pooled and the ones past the end are hidden rather than unmade,
-- which is the same trick the loadout tabs use and for the same reason.
--
-- A row is one of two things. A header is a dim word with no background and no
-- click, there to say what the rows under it are. An entry is a button with a
-- label, an accent mark down its left edge when it is the one you are reading,
-- and a count on the right when it holds something you have not read.
--
-- An entry may also carry three things a caller asks the whole column for, and
-- the quest log is what asked for all three. A glyph in front of the words,
-- which is a state the row is in rather than anything you can press. A note at
-- the right, which is a small number about the row that is not a count of
-- unread lines. And a strip of marks at the far right that you can press, one
-- per action the caller offers on every entry.
--
-- **The marks are drawn on every row rather than on the one under the cursor.**
-- Revealing them on hover is the tidier column and it is a trap: the cursor
-- moving from the row onto the mark leaves the row, the row repaints without
-- its marks, and the button the player was reaching for is gone before the
-- click lands. So they are always there, drawn quiet, and they brighten under
-- the cursor. What is quiet is legible and what is missing is not.
--
-- Rows are addressed by a string id rather than by position, because the
-- position of a whisper moves every time somebody else whispers you and the
-- selection has to survive that.
