-- The client's talent calls, behind one door
--
-- Every question the talent window asks the client is asked here, and nothing
-- else in the folder names a client function. That is the shape Quests/Client.lua
-- has and it is here for the same reason: the talent API is the one that moved
-- most between the two clients this addon runs on, and a window that asked
-- twelve globals in six places would break in six places on the next build.
--
-- **Three shapes of the same answer.** The anniversary client carries
-- C_SpecializationInfo, whose GetTalentInfo takes a query table and hands back a
-- record. Under it, and on the older client alone, GetTalentInfo takes a tab and
-- an index and answers a run of values, and that run itself comes in two
-- orders: the deprecated wrapper on the newer builds puts the prerequisite
-- flag seventh, the older client puts it eighth. The tab call is worse: the
-- points spent in a tree are the seventh value from C_SpecializationInfo, the
-- fifth from a GetTalentTabInfo that leads with a number, and the third from
-- one that leads with the name. Every one of those is probed at call time and
-- read by position, and the one thing no shape is trusted for is the
-- prerequisite flag, which the board works out for itself off the ranks.
--
-- **Read at call time, not at load.** Unit/Spec.lua takes GetTalentTabInfo
-- into a local when the file loads, which is the right economy for a call on
-- a ticker. Nothing here is on a ticker: a window paints when a point is spent
-- and when it opens. Reaching through _G each time costs a lookup and buys the
-- harness a way to stand the addon on the other client for one section
-- without reloading it.
--
-- **Groups are an argument everywhere, whether or not this client has them.**
-- Dual specialisation is two talent groups, one active. A client with one
-- group answers one to the count and ignores the argument on every other call,
-- so the window passes the group it is looking at down every read and the
-- client that cannot use it does not mind.

-- the client has fetched the talent's text reads as no answer both ways, and
