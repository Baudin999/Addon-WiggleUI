-- One tree, drawn
--
-- A heading with the tree's icon, its name and the points in it, and under it
-- a grid of squares: one per talent, at the tier and column the client places
-- it, with the lines between a talent and whatever it needs first.
--
-- **It is the bag window's square.** UI/Slot.lua's, with the count in the
-- corner reading `3/5` rather than a stack, because a talent is a picture with
-- a number on it the same as an item is and a window where the two differ by a
-- pixel of inset is the defect that file exists to stop. The rim carries the
-- state: gold once every rank is in, green while a point would land here, the
-- theme's edge for a talent half filled and nothing to fill it with, and the
-- hairline for one you cannot reach yet, whose picture is greyed the way the
-- client greys it.
--
-- **The lines are drawn, not pasted.** Blizzard's are cut from a sheet of
-- textures, thirty of them per frame, walked by a routine that keeps a grid of
-- which cell has which stub of art. This draws each requirement as one or two
-- flat rectangles, two pixels wide, in the tick colour when the requirement is
-- met and the quiet grey when it is not. The routing is the client's own: down
-- the column for a talent under its requirement, along the row for one beside
-- it, and for a diagonal pair over first and then down, unless a talent is in
-- the way, in which case down first and then over. Nothing points: every line
-- runs from a talent to the one it opens, and that is always downward or
-- sideways, so an arrowhead would be saying what the geometry already says.
--
-- **The requirement is worked out here, off the ranks.** The client answers a
-- flag for it, in a different slot on each of the two builds this addon runs
-- on, and a flag read from the wrong slot is a rim the wrong colour on every
-- square in the window. The board already holds every square in the tree, so
-- it asks which square a talent needs and whether that square is full, which
-- cannot be in the wrong slot.
--
-- **Everything is built once and pooled.** Squares are made as the tree first
-- needs them and hidden past the count on every paint after; the lines are a
-- second pool on the same grid. This client cannot destroy a frame, and a
-- board that rebuilt on every point spent would leak a tree per level.
--
-- Nothing here is on a ticker. A board is painted when the window opens, when
-- a point is spent, when a level lands and when the other spec is chosen, and
-- not otherwise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- One square, the air between two, and how many across. Thirty one is the bag
-- window's square and the argument for it is in UI/Slot.lua: twenty seven
-- pixels of picture inside a two pixel inset is one of the two sizes an icon
-- is drawn at exactly. Twenty eight between them is what the heading needs:
-- four squares and three gaps make two hundred and eight pixels, which holds
-- the icon, Marksmanship at the heading size and "41 points" with air between.
