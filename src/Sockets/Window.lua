--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The socketing window
--
-- Blizzard's socketing frame is three holes and a button, and everything it
-- does not tell you is what makes socketing tedious. It does not know what you
-- are carrying, so putting a gem in means finding it in your bags and dragging
-- it across the screen. It says whether a gem matched with a sparkle that is
-- over in half a second. And it names the gem you are about to destroy nowhere
-- at all: replacing one is a click, a confirm dialog with the word "gem" in it,
-- and a thing you owned is gone.
--
-- So this window is the item, its holes, and every gem in your bags that goes
-- in one, on one page. Click a hole, click a gem, and it is in front of that
-- hole. Nothing is spent until you press apply, and the line beside apply is
-- what applying costs you.
--
-- **The session drives the window and not the other way round.** Every route
-- into socketing on this client, the shift click on this addon's gear page and
-- the client's own on a bag square, ends in the same server session and the
-- same SOCKET_INFO_UPDATE. This window listens for that event rather than being
-- opened by the thing that started it, which is why a gesture the addon does
-- not own still lands here, and why there is one place that knows the window is
-- up.
--
-- **Closing the window ends the session.** That is the client's own rule for
-- this frame and it is why Sockets/Blizzard.lua parks Blizzard's rather than
-- hiding it. Ours closes on the cross, on escape and on the session ending
-- underneath, and only the first two call back into the client.
--
-- **The bonus line is the reading Blizzard's frame does not have.** An item
-- pays its socket bonus only when every hole holds a gem of its own colour, so
-- that is a yes or a no about the whole item rather than a sparkle per hole,
-- and it is the number you are actually socketing for. It is read off the
-- client's own `matches` for each hole rather than off the colour table in
-- Core/Sockets.lua, so the sentence cannot claim a bonus the server disagrees
-- with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The line under a hole holding a gem you have not paid for. Two pixels, the
