-- Two rails at the bottom of the screen
--
-- The experience bar and the reputation bar, drawn by this addon. They were the
-- last thing on the screen still wearing Blizzard's art: Artwork/Artwork.lua
-- strips the gryphons and the metal strip off the action bars and leaves these
-- two alone on purpose, because an experience bar is not furniture, it is a
-- reading. So the art came off the bars around it and the reading stayed in the
-- 2007 frame, which is the mismatch this file closes.
--
-- **One frame, up to two rails.** The experience rail is on top and the
-- reputation rail under it, which is the order the client has always drawn them
-- in and is the one thing about this widget nobody has to learn. A rail with
-- nothing to say is not drawn small or drawn empty, it is not there: at the
-- level cap the frame is the reputation rail alone, with no faction watched it
-- is the experience rail alone, and with neither there is no frame on the
-- screen at all. That is the same rule Buffs/Nag.lua ships, and it is worth
-- more here than a tidy rectangle: what is on the screen is what is true.
--
-- **Nothing here is on a ticker.** Experience moves when you kill something and
-- reputation moves when the client says it did, so this file draws on five
-- events and on nothing else. That is why no function in it is in check.sh's
-- HOT list and why the writes below are not guarded against the value already
-- on the widget: a guard is worth one comparison against a write that happens
-- on every frame, and these happen a few times a minute.
--
-- **The rested pool is drawn rather than written.** The section of the rail
-- between where you are and where the rested bonus runs out is a second fill in
-- the blue this game has used for it since it shipped. It is the one number on
-- the bar that changes what a kill is worth, and a player who is about to spend
-- an evening's rest should be able to see it without hovering anything.
--
-- **Twenty segments.** The marks across the experience rail are the bubbles the
-- client has drawn since 2004, and they are still the unit people count in.
-- They come off below 160 pixels of width, where twenty of anything is a
-- texture every eight pixels and the rail reads as hatching.
--
-- **Two styles.** Expressive is everything above: a placed, sized rail with
-- the palette's floor under it and its reading written on it. Minimal is the
-- bar DialogueUI draws under its dialogue, in this addon's own language: the
-- whole width of the screen, flush with the bottom edge, a few pixels tall and
-- nothing written on it. It keeps the hover, ten blocks rather than twenty,
-- the unit frames' tight chrome edge rather than the floor, and a soft light
-- on the fill's leading edge, which is where the eye goes on a line that thin.
-- It is not placed, because the screen edge is the place.
