-- How far along you are, asked of the client
--
-- Two readings and one clock, and nothing in here draws. Progress/Rails.lua is
-- the picture; this is every call the part makes to the game, which is the same
-- seam Quests/Client.lua and Mail/Send.lua draw and is drawn here for the usual
-- reason: the two clients disagree about which of these calls exists, and a
-- disagreement is easier to hold in one file than in the file that is also
-- placing textures.
--
-- **Experience.** Where you are in this level, what the level costs, and the
-- rested pool if there is one. Nil where there is no experience to draw at all,
-- which is three different states the bar treats as one: the level cap, a
-- character with experience switched off, and a client that will not say.
--
-- **The watched faction.** Whichever bar you put on the screen yourself, its
-- standing and where you are inside that standing's band. The client has
-- answered this two ways: a table out of C_Reputation on the newer builds and
-- five values out of GetWatchedFactionInfo on the older ones. Both are asked
-- for, in that order, because this addon ships for a backported client where
-- the answer is genuinely either.
--
-- **The clock is this file's own arithmetic and not the client's.** Nothing in
-- the game will tell you what you are earning an hour, so the tally here
-- watches every experience change and divides. It runs whether or not the bars
-- are drawn, because a rate that started counting when you opened the settings
-- window is a rate about the settings window.
--
-- The tally is per level and it is kept in this character's saved variables, so
-- the estimate is still there after a logout. Those are the same decision made
-- twice: a level is the span the estimate is about, and an hour of it spent
-- yesterday is an hour of evidence about the level you are on now. A level up
-- throws it away, because a rate carried into a level is a rate about the one
-- before it, which is the level that was cheaper.
