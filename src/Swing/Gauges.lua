-- Two bars and a mark
--
-- One gauge per hand, drawn with ns.UI.Gauge on the pixel grid, and the Slam
-- band drawn over the main hand one. No window round them, no text on them and
-- no chrome at all, for the reason Meter/Window.lua carries: this is read out
-- of the corner of your eye during a pull and every pixel of frame around it
-- is a pixel of the fight it stands on.
--
-- The bar counts in pixels rather than in a fraction from zero to one, so the
-- band, the mark and the fill are all measured in the same units. That is what
-- makes "press on the mark" mean anything: a band at 70.4 percent of a 180
-- pixel bar and a mark at 70.6 percent of it are the same pixel and the eye
-- cannot tell which side of the line it is on.
--
-- The band and the mark land on whole pixels. The fill does not, and this file
-- is where the addon's two pixel rules first disagree. Both are in
-- docs/README.md and both are gated in scripts/harness.lua.
--
-- A static edge lands on a whole pixel. A border, an icon crop or a band drawn
-- across two rows of pixels reads as blurry, and blurry is what the grid exists
-- to stop. The band and the mark move only when your weapon speed does, which
-- is a few times a fight, so they are static edges.
--
-- A moving fill is not quantised. What the eye reads on a moving edge is its
-- velocity, and velocity lives in where the edge sits between two pixels as
-- much as in which pixel it is on. Rounding throws that away to buy a sharpness
-- nobody can see on something in motion, and rounding is also a throttle: the
-- fill crosses 180 units in a 3.4 second swing, so a rounded fill changes value
-- 53 times a second and no oftener, whatever rate the tick runs at. It stands
-- still on 7 of the 60 frames a 60 Hz screen draws and on 91 of the 144 a fast
-- one draws, and each move is a whole unit, which is three screen pixels at
-- swing zoom 3. Deleting the 20 Hz ticker raised the drawn rate from 20 to 53
-- and left that second throttle standing, which is why the bar still stepped
-- after the first repair.
--
-- So the fill is written as a fraction, on every frame a hand is swinging, with
-- no comparison in front of it except the one that catches a hand that is not.
-- What that costs was measured rather than argued: the harness reads 0.03 KB
-- per fifty ticks rounded and guarded, and 0.03 unguarded.
--
-- Every other part of this addon draws on a ticker, because every other part is
-- a readout and a readout fifty milliseconds stale is one nobody can fault.
-- This one is an animation, and an animation is drawn on the frame the screen
-- is drawn on or it is drawn in steps.
--
-- Mouse only while unlocked, the same as the meters and the charge icon, and
-- for the same reason: a mouse enabled frame swallows the right button drag
-- that turns the camera, and this sits under the middle of the screen where
-- that drag starts.

-- between two swings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Fraction returns zero for a hand with no swing running, so a bar between
-- swings draws empty without a branch here.
--
-- The one comparison is the empty bar. A hand that is not swinging answers zero
-- on every frame for as long as you stand there, and writing zero onto a bar
-- already at zero is a measure and a relayout for a bar nobody can see moving.
-- A hand that is swinging fails the test on its first frame and is written on
-- every frame after it, which is what the header above argues for: the velocity
-- of the edge is read out of where it sits between two pixels, and a frame it
-- does not write is a frame it does not move on.
