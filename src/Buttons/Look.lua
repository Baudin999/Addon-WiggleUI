-- What one bar looks like, and when it is up
--
-- The third question about a cloned bar. Buttons/Which.lua answers which bars
-- there are and which of them you want, Buttons/Placing.lua answers where one
-- goes, and this answers what shape it is, what colour it is drawn in and
-- whether it is on the screen at all right now.
--
-- Its own file for the reason those two are theirs. Buttons/Bars.lua is what a
-- bar is made of: twelve secure buttons, the slots they press, the keys they
-- answer to and the client's own buttons hidden behind them. None of that
-- changes when you ask for three rows instead of one, and none of what is in
-- here knows what an action slot is.
--
-- Every setting is per bar and every one of them has a default that is not a
-- setting. The shape's default is the plan's `columns` in Which.lua, the
-- colour's is the window colour every other surface in the addon is painted
-- in, and both visibility answers default to no. So a bar nobody has touched
-- carries no record at all, `ns.db.barLook` is empty on a fresh install, and
-- `actionbars plain` is a deletion rather than a write. That is the shape
-- Which.lua already uses for the tick boxes and the argument is the same one:
-- the shipping state travels with a clone of the repo, and a saved variable
-- that merely restates it is a saved variable that can drift from it.
--
-- Two of the five cannot be done from Lua at all, which is why they are here
-- rather than in a switch somewhere.
--
--   Hiding a bar in combat. Everything inside a bar is a secure button, and a
--   frame with one of those under it cannot be shown or hidden while the
--   client is in lockdown. Combat starting is exactly the moment you would
--   want to, so the only path is a visibility state driver: the client
--   evaluates the macro conditions itself, inside the restricted environment,
--   and does the hiding on its own account. Same machinery as the page driver
--   in Bars.lua and the charge key's binder, and probed the same way, because
--   nothing installed here proves it is on 2.5.6.
--
--   Showing a bar while a key is held. The same driver, on `[mod:shift]`
--   rather than on `[combat]`. A key held is not an event Lua is told about
--   often enough to drive a frame off, and hiding on the up edge would be a
--   protected call again the moment you were in a fight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Twelve, the same twelve Buttons/Bars.lua lays out. Written here as well
-- because this file loads first and the shape arithmetic is the whole of what
-- it does: the rows below are the ways twelve breaks into a rectangle.
local SLOTS = 12

-- The shapes twelve buttons make. Every one of these divides twelve, because a
-- last row with a gap on the end of it is not a bar, it is a bar and a stump.
-- One row is the bar every client ships, twelve rows is the column down the
-- side of the screen, and the four between them are the same twelve buttons
-- folded.
Look.ROWS = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 }

-- 27, and it is not a taste decision. UI.IconSizes answers { 54, 27 } on this
-- client: an icon is stored at 64 texels, the crop that takes the border baked
-- into every one of them off leaves 54, and the client keeps each copy at half
-- the size of the one above. Those two are the only drawn sizes where one
-- stored texel lands on one pixel. 32 and 36, which is what every bar addon
-- ships, are the client blending two copies, and halfway between two of them is
-- the worst place to stand.
--
-- It is a setting anyway, and the two facts sit together rather than one
-- winning. A bar you want out of the way at the edge of the screen is worth
-- more small than it is worth sharp, and a bar you press all night is worth
-- more sharp than it is worth any particular size. So the default is the sharp
-- one, the range covers both of them, the step is one pixel so neither can be
-- stepped over, and Look.Sharp says which is which rather than the panel
-- pretending every stop is as good as the next.
local DEFAULT_SIZE = 27

-- The key's font, in whole pixels, for the reason Ability.Size floors every
-- string on a square: a glyph at a fractional size is rasterised across two
-- rows. One pixel is therefore the finest step there is, and the range is kept
-- to what a key can be on a square so every stop on the slider is a few
-- pixels of drag apart. Seven is the floor the square already had; 32 is a
-- key a little over the 28 a 54px square gives it.
local KEY_LOW, KEY_HIGH = 7, 32

-- Ninety five rather than the ninety seven the window colour carries, because
-- the opacity control is in fives and a stop the panel cannot reach is a
-- number nobody can put back. Two hundredths of an alpha on a background is
-- not a look anybody has ever seen.
local DEFAULT_ALPHA = 95

-- What a bar can be painted. Eight, named rather than mixed, for the reason the
-- geometry in Which.lua is source code: this is an addon for one person who
-- wants the same interface on every install, and a colour you dialled in with
-- three sliders is a colour that lives in one WTF folder.
--
-- The first two are the theme's own, so a bar left alone matches every other
-- surface the addon paints. The six after them are deliberately dark and
-- deliberately flat: this is the ground under twelve pieces of Blizzard icon
-- art, and anything with saturation in it fights the art rather than holding
-- it.
