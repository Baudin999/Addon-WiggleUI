--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What one square answers to the mouse
--
-- Buttons/Bars.lua builds the squares, points each one at an action slot and
-- draws what that slot is doing. None of that involves the cursor. This file is
-- the other half: what happens when you put the mouse on a square and what
-- happens when you drag something onto it.
--
-- Split out when Bars.lua crossed the 800 line gate, and the seam is a real one
-- rather than the first convenient cut. Everything here hangs a script on a
-- button and touches the cursor; nothing here knows what a bar is, how many
-- there are, or which slot a square points at, because it reads that off the
-- button's own action attribute the same way the tick does.
--
-- Both were on Bars.lua's list of what a square deliberately was not, and
-- neither should have been.
--
-- The tooltip, which is how you find out what rank of Rend the loadout put in
-- slot four without dragging anything anywhere. It is also the loudest thing
-- missing from a square standing in for a button that has one: hovering a bar
-- and getting nothing back reads as broken, not as minimal.
--
-- And the drag, which was refused because PickupAction and PlaceAction on a
-- frame you can drop anything onto is a way to lose a bar to a misclick. The
-- risk is real and the conclusion did not follow, because the alternative on
-- offer was worse: with Blizzard's buttons hidden underneath, nothing could be
-- dropped on a bar at all, so learning a spell meant turning the whole clone
-- off to place it and back on afterwards. A misclick moves one slot and drops
-- what it picked up back where it came from. Nothing is destroyed and the
-- picture is right on the next tick.
--
-- OnEnter, OnLeave, OnDragStart and OnReceiveDrag are none of them protected,
-- which is why a secure action button will take all four in plain Lua. Nothing
-- here runs on a ticker.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What is on this square, said in the client's own words.
--
-- OnEnter and OnLeave are not protected, so this is one of the few things a
-- secure button will let an addon put on it in plain Lua. The slot is read off
-- the button's own action attribute for the reason Bars.Update reads it there:
-- it is what a press would actually reach, whether Lua wrote it or the stance
-- snippet did.
--
-- Refused for an empty slot rather than left to the client. Asking for the text
-- of a slot with nothing in it comes back with nothing, and a hover that draws
-- nothing leaves whatever the last tooltip said on screen, anchored to a square
-- that has no ability, which is worse than no tooltip at all.
--
-- The box is the addon's own. The words in it are still the client's, read off
-- a hidden tooltip by UI/Scan.lua, because the rank, the cost and the range on
-- an action slot are computed inside the game and nothing hands them over as
-- data. So a square says exactly what Blizzard's own square would have said,
-- drawn in the same chrome as everything else this addon puts on the screen.
--
-- Hung here rather than through ns.Tip.Hang because an empty square closes the
-- box on the spot, below, rather than opening on nothing.
local function Tooltip(w)
	w:SetScript("OnEnter", function(self)
		local slot = self:GetAttribute("action")
		if not slot or not ns.Slot.Texture(slot) then
			-- Closed rather than left alone, and closed on the spot rather than
			-- left to linger. Without the first the last square's text stays on
			-- screen pointing at one with nothing in it; without the second it
			-- does the same for a second, which is long enough to read and be
			-- wrong about. Entering a thing always replaces the box, and a
			-- thing with nothing to say replaces it with none.
			ns.Tip.Close(true)
			return
		end
		-- On the square, whatever the tooltip setting says. What is in this
		-- slot is a question about the icon under the pointer, and the game has
		-- answered it beside the button since there were action bars.
		ns.Tip.Open(self, { kind = "action", slot = slot }, nil, ns.UI.Tooltip.BESIDE)

end

-- Picking a slot up and putting one down.
--
-- The two halves of one gesture and the only way to fill a square by hand,
-- because the Blizzard button this one stands over is hidden and cannot be
-- dropped on.
--
-- Both go through ns.Layout.CanCarry rather than testing the API here. That
-- file already probes PickupAction and PlaceAction, already knows this client
-- may not have them, and already refuses in combat. A second probe would be a
-- second answer to a question that has one.
--
-- Deliberately not Layout.CanWrite, which also refuses while the cursor is
-- holding something. That is the right question for a loadout filling twelve
-- slots from empty hands and the wrong one here: a drop happens with a spell on
-- the cursor by definition, and asking CanWrite would refuse every drop with
-- "put down what you are holding first".

-- A refusal nobody can see is indistinguishable from a bar that ignores the
-- mouse, which is what this cost an evening to find out.
--
-- Both halves used to answer a false CanCarry with a bare return. The spell
-- stayed on the cursor, the square stayed empty, and nothing on screen said
-- why. Two of the three reasons that call can refuse are permanent for the
-- session, because this client has no PickupAction or no PlaceAction at all,
-- and that is worth one line in chat rather than an evening of dragging.
--
-- Once per reason rather than once per square: a drag along a bar passes over
-- twelve of them and twelve identical lines is not a better answer than one.
-- Keyed by the line itself, so a second thing going wrong still gets said;
-- the first version latched on the first message and swallowed every other
-- reason for the rest of the session, which is the same silence one layer up.
--
-- Combat is never reported, because it clears on its own and because a fight
-- is when the chat frame has the least room for a sentence you did not need.
