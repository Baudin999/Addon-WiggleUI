-- Fills the action bars with a warrior loadout and can put back exactly what
-- was there before. Two jobs are deliberately not done here:
--
--   Keybindings. Nothing in this file calls SetBinding or SaveBindings. The
--   bar 1 and bar 2 keys are already bound in the binding set, so the loadout
--   only has to write the slots those keys point at. That keeps the README's
--   rule about never touching a saved binding intact.
--
--   Frame positions. Where the bars sit is Edit Mode's job, and driving the
--   Edit Mode manager from an addon is a much larger and much more fragile
--   thing than writing action slots. Layout in this file means what is in the
--   slots, not where the bar is.
--
-- Nothing here is reachable in combat. PlaceAction is protected, and unlike
-- the charge button there is no reason to queue a bar rewrite for when combat
-- drops, so it refuses instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The plan
--
-- Not here. What goes in which slot is a fact about your class and lives in
-- Class/<yours>.lua as `loadout`. This file is the mechanism: which action
-- slots the bars drive, how to put a spell in one, and how to hand back exactly
-- what was there before. None of that changes with the class.
--
-- A plan is four fields.
--
--   pages   the page keys, in the order the `stance:` macro conditional counts
--           them. One key for a class that does not page bar 1 at all, which is
--           most of them.
--   single  which page to write when the plan has several and the client is not
--           paging: no stance, or a bar the client will not tell us about.
--   macros  what has to exist before the plan can be placed. Created per
--           character, prefixed so Restore finds exactly what was made.
--   bar1    twelve rows, one per physical key, each with a cell per page. The
--           row is the job that key does and the cells are how that job is done
--           on each page, which is what makes them one row.
--   bar2    twelve cells, the shift layer, which does not page.
--
-- Nil for a class nobody has written a plan for. Nil is the whole gate:
-- CanApply refuses, Buttons/Feature.lua opens no page, and nothing is ever
-- written to a bar it could not fill.
--
-- Read on demand rather than held at load, because the class is not reliably
-- known while the files load.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Can this client do it
--
-- Nothing installed here calls the action-writing API unguarded, so unlike
-- the rest of the addon these are not confirmed to exist. Details references
-- all of them but only inside luaserver.lua, which is a language-server stub
-- rather than running code, so it proves nothing. Probe instead of assume,
-- the same way BuildBinder probes for RegisterStateDriver.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Two lists, because there are two sizes of job here and they need different
-- amounts of the client.
--
-- Moving one slot onto another needs two calls. That is what a drag from
-- Buttons/Bars.lua is, and holding it to the whole list below would refuse a
-- gesture over five functions it never touches.
--
-- Composing a loadout needs the rest: it picks spells and macros up by name,
-- reads back what a slot ended up holding, and puts the cursor down when it is
-- finished. Everything in CARRY as well, which is why CanWrite is CanCarry plus
-- this rather than a list of its own.

local COMPOSE = {
	"PickupSpell", "PickupMacro", "ClearCursor", "GetCursorInfo", "GetActionInfo",

--

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
