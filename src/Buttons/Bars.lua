--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The bars
--
-- A clone of whichever action bars you already have, drawn as squares this
-- addon owns, reading the same action slots and answering the same keys.
-- Blizzard's own buttons are hidden underneath, and the off switch puts them
-- back without a reload.
--
-- Three things it deliberately does not invent.
--
--   Slots. Every square reads a Blizzard action slot, the one the button it
--   replaced was reading. Buttons/Layout.lua writes those slots and your saved
--   keybindings already point at them, so a clone with a slot space of its own
--   would need both rewritten to say the same thing twice.
--
--   Keys. Every key is read off the binding set with GetBindingKey and put
--   back on top of it with SetOverrideBindingClick. Nothing here calls
--   SetBinding or SaveBindings, which is the README's hard rule and is what
--   makes the off switch free: an override is a layer, not a write, and
--   dropping it leaves the binding set exactly as it was found.
--
--   Which bars exist. Buttons/Which.lua holds the plan of what this client can
--   have and answers which of them you want, and the shipping answer is read
--   off your own bars: one you have on is one we clone. This file builds what
--   that question returns and hands back what it does not.
--
-- Where a bar sits and what shape it is are two different answers and neither
-- is in this file. Buttons/Placing.lua owns the position, because a position is
-- the one thing you cannot sensibly type. Buttons/Look.lua owns the rest of the
-- bar you can see: how many rows the twelve break into, what colour the ground
-- under them is, how much of it there is, and whether the bar is on screen in
-- combat or only while a key is held. This file asks that one what to draw and
-- draws it.
--
-- What the client will not let this file do, and how each is answered:
--
--   Rewrite an attribute in combat. A stance change happens mid-fight, and
--   pointing bar 1 at the next twelve slots is an attribute write, so it
--   cannot be done from Lua at all. It is done by a snippet running inside a
--   SecureHandlerStateTemplate off RegisterStateDriver, which is the same
--   machinery Charge/Icon.lua already uses to drop its key in combat, and it is
--   probed the same way, because nothing installed here proves it is on 2.5.6.
--   Bars.CanPage says which path came up.
--
--   Bind, unbind, hide or show a protected frame in combat. Every one of those
--   is in Bars.Apply, Bars.ApplyBindings or Bars.Restyle, and each is held to
--   the end of the fight by ns.Lockdown.Held.
--
-- What a square deliberately is not: a Blizzard action button. It casts, it
-- draws what the slot is doing, it carries its key, it names what is on it when
-- you hover it, and you can drag a spell onto it. Filling a slot is
-- Buttons/Layout.lua's job or the spellbook's, and both write the same slots
-- these squares read, so the picture updates on the next tick either way.
--
-- What one square answers to the mouse is Buttons/Square.lua, which is where
-- the tooltip and the drag live and where the argument for both is written
-- down. This file builds the squares and points them at slots; that one hangs
-- the scripts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Ten a second, which is what the charge icon runs at and is the rate a
-- cooldown timer has to be redrawn at for the tenths under ten seconds to
-- count down rather than jump. Every square is walked on every pass, and a
-- square nothing has happened to costs one read and a comparison rather than
-- the twelve to sixteen reads the whole ladder is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The plan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How big a square is is a setting now, in Buttons/Look.lua, which is also
-- where the argument for the 27 it defaults to is written down and where the
-- harness asserts that default is a size this client can draw sharp.
--
-- The gap between two squares and the pad round the twelve are not settings.
-- They are two pixels and three, they are what makes a bar look like one thing
-- rather than twelve, and nothing is answered by asking a player for them.

--             range; false for a heal, a totem or an empty square
--   counting  a real cooldown is running, so the number over it has to be
--             written again on every pass

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The tick
--
-- One ticker for every square on every bar, on a frame that is never hidden,
-- because a hidden frame's OnUpdate stops and never starts again. Everything
-- below runs against sixty squares ten times a second, so nothing allocates and
-- nothing writes a value already on the widget. check.sh's HOT list holds the
-- tick and everything under it to both.
--
-- What a pass no longer does is ask the client what every square is doing.
-- Reading one square is twelve to sixteen calls, and at five bars that was
-- eight thousand calls a second spent redrawing a bar that had not moved. So an
-- event raises a bit on the squares it could have changed and the pass draws
-- those. That is what Blizzard's own ActionButton does on this client: it
-- carries a stateDirty flag set out of its event handler, applies it at the top
-- of its OnUpdate, and spends the rest of the pass on the range check.
--
-- Three things move with nothing sent to say so, and all three are on the pass.
--
--   Range. One IsActionInRange per square holding an attack, and only while
--   something is targeted, which is the one call Blizzard keeps on its own tick.
--
--   The stack on an item. One GetActionCount per square.
--
--   A reaction window shutting. Buttons/Reaction.lua answers that for the whole
--   bar in one clock read, because a window running out is the one thing on the
--   ladder the client sends nothing at all for.
--
-- A square counting down is drawn on every pass as well. The tenths under ten
-- seconds are a number this addon prints in Lua rather than a swipe the client
-- animates, so a frozen square is a frozen number.
--
-- The slot is read back off the button's own action attribute rather than
-- worked out from the stance again. That attribute is what a press actually
-- reaches, whether Lua wrote it or the secure snippet did, so the square draws
-- what the button does by construction rather than by two pieces of code
-- agreeing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Raise the bit on every square, or on the ones pointing at one action slot.
--
-- Nothing is drawn here. The handler says what moved and the next pass draws
-- it, which is at most a tenth of a second later and is the rate the squares
-- were being drawn at anyway. Drawing from the handler instead would put a
-- sixty square repaint inside ACTIONBAR_UPDATE_USABLE, which fires on every
-- point of rage a warrior gains.
--
-- A slot of zero is the client saying it changed something and not which, which
-- is the same reading Blizzard's own button takes off ACTIONBAR_SLOT_CHANGED,
-- and it means every square.
