-- Where each cloned bar sits, and how you move it.
--
-- Its own file because Buttons/Bars.lua is what a bar *is* and this is where it
-- *goes*, and because the two answer to different masters. What shape a bar is
-- and what colour it is drawn in are settings, in Buttons/Look.lua, and you
-- type them. Its position is the one thing you cannot sensibly type, so this is
-- the only part of the bars you drive with the mouse.
--
-- The drag handle here is the third in the addon, after Charge/Icon.lua and
-- Meter/Window.lua. If a fourth turns up it belongs in the UI layer as one
-- shared widget, the way UI/Gauge.lua and UI/Ability.lua were both extracted on
-- their second copy. Three is the point at which that becomes worth saying out
-- loud and not yet the point at which Meter's version, which enables the mouse
-- on the frame itself rather than laying a handle over it, is worth rewriting.
--
-- Two locks reach these bars and they answer different questions.
--
--   `ns.db.locked` is the addon's. /wk unlock puts every frame in the addon
--   into placing mode at once, and every handle in here comes up with it.
--
--   `ns.db.barsLocked` is the bars' own, and it is what shift-dragging is. On,
--   which is the shipping answer, a bar cannot be moved at all without the
--   command above. Off, holding shift puts the handles up for as long as you
--   hold it, so a bar can be nudged mid-session without a command and without
--   leaving every other frame in the addon unlocked while you do it.
--
-- The cost of the second one is stated rather than hidden: a handle is a frame
-- laid over the whole bar and it takes every click that lands on it, so while
-- shift is down a shift-click on a square goes to the handle instead of to the
-- square. That is why it is a setting and why the setting ships off.

-- How deep a bar stands, which is the other half of where it is.
--
-- Blizzard's `MainActionBar` is declared `enableMouse="true"` on MEDIUM at frame
-- level 50, sized 454 by 35 and anchored to the bottom of UIParent.
-- Buttons/Blizzard.lua hides the twelve buttons standing on it and a hidden
-- frame takes no mouse, but the bar frame under them is not hidden and is not
-- ours to hide: that corner of the client carries the micro menu and the bag bar
-- too, which is the warning Artwork.lua already writes down. Strip its art,
-- which is the shipping setting, and what is left is an invisible frame across
-- the bottom of the screen that takes every click landing on it.
--
-- A frame built on UIParent starts at level 1. Fifty beats one, so every drop
-- and every click aimed at bar 1 went into a frame with no drag handler and
-- vanished, while the keys, which never ask the mouse anything, went on working.
-- Bar 1 only, mouse only, and nothing on screen to see, because the thing
-- swallowing the click had already had its art taken off.
--
-- The other four bars were never affected and Blizzard's own source says why:
-- MultiBarBottomLeft, MultiBarBottomRight, MultiBarLeft and MultiBarRight are
-- each declared on MEDIUM with no `enableMouse` at all, so none of them has ever
-- taken a click. MainActionBar is the one action bar frame in the client that
-- does, which is exactly why exactly one bar was broken.
--
-- 120 rather than 51, and the headroom is the point. The end caps and the page
-- number inside that bar are declared at level 100 and neither takes the mouse
-- today; a number that already clears the frames which could start taking it is
-- a number nobody has to come back to.
local LEVEL = 120

-- Stand one bar up where the mouse can reach it. Once, at build.
--
-- The header carries its own level rather than inheriting one. A child does
-- start a level above its parent and the squares rely on exactly that, but the
-- level the squares are hit-tested at is the whole of this bug, and a number
-- that load bearing is written down rather than left to a default no file
-- states. The strata is set first because SetFrameStrata re-seats a frame in the
-- new strata's own order, so a level written before it is a level thrown away.

-- Where a bar sits: what you dragged it to, or what the plan says.
--
-- The plan is the record and the drag is the tool. A position saved in WTF does
-- not travel, and an addon whose whole point is that a fresh install looks right
-- cannot keep where its bars live somewhere a fresh install has never seen. So
-- dragging writes an override you can feel your way to, `actionbars where`
-- prints the two lines to paste into the plan above, and `actionbars reset`
-- drops the override once you have. Same shape as bake-ui.sh, without the round
-- trip through a shell.

--
-- Not "ask the screen how wide it is and halve it". An anchor with its
-- horizontal half taken off, held to UIParent at zero, is centred by the client
-- at every resolution and stays centred when the resolution changes, and no
