--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Blizzard's own buttons
--
-- Hidden one button at a time, and deliberately NOT through ns.Strip.
--
-- ns.Strip swaps a region's Show for its Hide, which is exactly right for the
-- thing it was written for: a texture, which no protected code path ever calls
-- a method on. It is the wrong tool here and the difference is not cosmetic.
-- These are secure action buttons, and the client's own bar controller calls
-- Show on them from code that goes on to perform protected actions. An addon's
-- function executing inside that call stack taints it, and a tainted stack is
-- how you get "Interface action failed because of an AddOn" on a press,
-- halfway through a fight, with nothing on screen saying why.
--
-- Skin.lua looks like a precedent for stripping and is the opposite of one. It
-- strips regions of PlayerFrame and TargetFrame and says in its own header that
-- the frame itself is never hidden, because it is a secure unit button. The
-- rule this file follows is that same rule: strip what Blizzard draws, never
-- what Blizzard clicks.
--
-- So: statehidden and Hide, which is the channel Blizzard's own show and hide
-- logic reads, and no method on their frame is ever replaced. The cost is that
-- the client can still put a button back, on a page change or on entering the
-- world, so those events re-hide. That is a handful of Hide calls on events
-- that fire a few times a session, against a taint that is silent until it
-- costs you a taunt.
--
-- The holders are not hidden. Bar 1's twelve are parented to
-- MainMenuBarArtFrame along with the micro menu and the bag bar, and hiding
-- that takes all three, which is the warning Artwork.lua already carries.
--
-- They are silenced instead, and that is the whole of the bar 1 drop bug.
--
-- A hidden button takes no mouse. The frame it was standing on is not hidden,
-- and on this client `MainActionBar` is mouse enabled in the TOOLTIP strata,
-- which is the top one there is: it sits invisible across the bottom of the
-- screen with its art stripped, above every strata a bar of ours could stand
-- in, and it takes every drop aimed at bar 1. `/wui actionbars trace` printed it
-- in one line after two fixes had guessed at frame levels, which is a number
-- that cannot win an argument with a strata.
--
-- So the mouse comes off it, not the frame off the screen. Nothing that frame
-- does with a click is anything the player wanted: it has no drag handler and
-- no click handler, it exists to stop a press reaching the world, and our own
-- bar standing over it does that job now. The micro menu and the bag bar are
-- children with a mouse of their own and are untouched, because EnableMouse is
-- per frame and never inherited.
--
-- Walked up from the buttons rather than named. The frame that took the drop is
-- an ancestor of the button it was standing on, whatever it happens to be
-- called on whichever client this is, and only an ancestor that actually takes
-- the mouse is touched: the four multi-bars are declared with no enableMouse at
-- all and stay exactly as they were found. UIParent ends the walk, because
-- silencing that is silencing the interface.
--
-- Only the buttons of bars this file actually cloned are touched. Hiding a bar
-- the player has switched off would mean the off switch showed it, and an off
-- switch that turns something on is worse than one that does nothing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--
-- Every ancestor is collected and not only the ones taking the mouse right now,
-- which is the difference between a switch and a loop. The pass below silences
-- the ones that are listening; a pass after that would find them deaf, leave
-- them out, and hand the mouse straight back to the frame it had just taken it
-- from. Whether a frame is worth silencing is decided once, at the moment it is

--
-- One call rather than a hide and a show, because the two halves have to agree
-- and there is a switch per bar that can move a button from one side to the
-- other. A bar unticked in the panel stops naming its twelve here, and the same
-- pass that stops hiding them is the pass that gives them back; nothing has to
