--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Which bars there are, and which of them you want
--
-- The plan and the question. Buttons/Bars.lua is what a bar is made of and
-- Buttons/Placing.lua is where it goes; this is which bars exist at all.
--
-- Split out because the answer stopped being a reading of the client. It used
-- to be one line inside Discover: clone a bar if Blizzard's frame for it is up.
-- That is the right default and the wrong rule, because it left the player no
-- way to say "clone the bottom left bar and leave the right one to Blizzard",
-- and no way at all to clone a bar whose Blizzard frame is switched off even
-- though its twelve slots are still there and your keys still point at them.
--
-- So there are two answers per bar and the saved one wins:
--
--   nothing saved, which is the shipping state, means follow the client. A bar
--   you have on is a bar we clone. That is "clone from your current bars" with
--   no setting to find and nothing to press, and it is why turning the feature
--   on gives you back what you already had.
--
--   a saved true or false is a decision, and from then on the client's own
--   switch is not consulted for that bar. Unticking every box puts the whole
--   thing back to following the client.
--
-- Nothing here draws, hides or binds anything. It answers a question about a
-- bar and hands the answer to Bars.lua, which owns every frame.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Every bar this client can have, in draw order.
--
--   label     what the bar is called in a sentence, and `tab` the same name
--             short enough to sit in a tab strip. Two rather than one because
--             "bottom left bar" reads correctly in a status line and takes
--             three lines of a 180 pixel rail; the strip in the panel carries
--             one of these per bar and has to fit five of them.
--   buttons   the Blizzard button name the slot is read off and which then gets
--             hidden. Hiding the twelve buttons rather than the frame holding
--             them is deliberate: bar 1's buttons live on MainMenuBarArtFrame
--             along with the micro menu and the bag bar, and Artwork.lua
--             already carries the note about what hiding that frame costs.
--   command   the binding command its keys are saved under
--   frame     the Blizzard frame whose IsShown is the default answer to whether
--             you want this bar. nil for bar 1, which is always wanted
--   pages     bar 1 alone, which the client re-points at a different twelve
--             slots in each stance
--
-- The rest is geometry: how many columns the twelve break into by default, and
-- where the bar's corner lands on UIParent. Those offsets are in the bar's own
-- units, and every bar goes on the pixel grid, so they are whole screen pixels
-- and mean the same thing on a 1080p panel as on a 4K one.
--
-- `columns` is the default and not the answer. Buttons/Look.lua holds a row
-- count per bar and the plan is what it falls back to, so what is written here
-- is what the client draws that bar as and what a bar nobody has reshaped
-- comes up as.
--
-- The three bottom bars stack from 83 rather than from 29 because the swing
-- timer and the experience bar sit under them. That is a layout decision and it
-- lives here rather than in Core\Shipped.lua with the rest of the shipped
-- screen: an entry in barPoints means "this bar was dragged", every part of
-- this feature reads an absent one as "the plan", and a capture that carried
-- the drags would say every bar on a fresh install had been moved.
-- scripts/bake-defaults.lua steps over the three keys for that reason and says
-- so; `/wui bars where` prints a dragged position in the shape of a line here.

-- looked is still cloned. Build in Bars.lua leaves a bar already built exactly
-- as it is, which is what makes asking twice safe.
