--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What one action slot is doing
--
-- The same answers Charge/Charge.lua works out for the three charge abilities,
-- worked out for an action slot instead. Both hand their answer to
-- UI/Ability.lua, which draws it, and neither knows the other exists.
--
-- Why two sources and not one. A charge display asks "would a press put this
-- ability on that mob", where the mob is picked by camera or by cursor and the
-- ability is picked by combat state, so the whole question is resolved in Lua
-- before any slot is involved. A bar button asks "would a press do what is in
-- this slot", where the slot is whatever the loadout wrote and the client owns
-- every part of the answer. The ladders look alike because they draw on the
-- same vocabulary; the inputs have nothing in common.
--
-- What they do share is the order, and the order is the design. What cannot be
-- fixed at all comes first, then what a click on something fixes, then what a
-- stance swap or a few seconds of rage fixes, then range. Reversing any two of
-- those makes the square say the less useful of two true things: a spell you
-- have no rage for and are also out of range of is a spell to walk towards,
-- and one you are out of range of and cannot cast in this stance is a spell to
-- swap for.
--
-- Everything here runs on the bar's ticker against every button on it, so
-- nothing allocates and nothing is cached that the client already holds.
-- check.sh's HOT list covers Slot.State, Slot.Spell, Slot.Aimless, Slot.Aiming,
-- Slot.Range, Slot.Count, Slot.Active and Slot.Equipped.
--
-- What the bar asks on a tick and what it asks on a repaint are two different
-- questions now, and this file answers both. Buttons/Bars.lua draws a square
-- when an event says something about it moved, and otherwise asks it only
-- Slot.Range and Slot.Count, so the whole ladder runs on the squares that
-- changed rather than on all sixty of them ten times a second.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Below this a cooldown is the global and not the ability's own, and the two
-- are worth different things on the square.
--
-- A real cooldown is a status: it is why the press did nothing, it lasts long
-- enough to plan around, and it gets a number counting down over it. The global
-- is not a status at all. It is one and a half seconds, every ability has it,
-- and greying the whole bar for it would say twenty-four true and useless
-- things at once.
--
-- What the global does get is the swipe, with no number and no status change.
-- This file used to withhold that too, on the grounds that a bar sweeping on
-- every press is a strobe. It is, and that strobe is the only thing on screen
-- that answers a key press: below the global a rage dump has no cooldown, no
-- colour change and nothing to count, so a bar that also refused the swipe
-- changed no pixel at all when you pressed it. That is what made the squares
-- feel like a picture of a bar rather than a bar. Blizzard's own buttons sweep,
-- and so does every bar addon; withholding it was the odd choice.
--
-- So Slot.State returns the cooldown numbers whether or not it returns the
-- "cooldown" status, and UI/Ability.lua draws the swipe off the numbers and the
-- countdown off the status.
--
-- Stated as its own constant rather than shared with Charge/Charge.lua's,
-- which holds the identical 1.5. They are the same number for the same reason
-- and could be one, but the charge abilities are three known spells on a
-- warrior and a bar slot is anything at all, so a client that ever moved one
-- would not have moved the other.
local GCD = 1.5

-- Which unit a range check is asked about. The client answers for the target
-- and nothing else, which is the honest limit of a range indicator on a bar:
-- with nothing targeted there is no distance to be out of.
local RANGE_UNIT = "target"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Can this client do it
--
-- Probed rather than assumed, the same way Buttons/Layout.lua probes the
-- action-writing API. None of these five is confirmed to exist on 2.5.6 by
-- anything installed here, and a bar that raises once per button per tick is
-- worse than a bar that draws every square grey.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

local NEEDED = {
	"HasAction", "GetActionTexture", "GetActionCooldown",
	"IsUsableAction", "IsActionInRange",
}

-- nil until asked, then true or a reason string.
--
-- Every reader below goes through Slot.CanRead rather than testing this
-- directly, and that is not tidiness. Nil means nobody has looked yet, and a
-- reader that read nil as "cannot read" answered "empty" for every slot on
-- every bar: the only caller that asked was Bars.Describe, so the squares came
-- up blank at login and filled in the moment you typed /wui. A guard that gives
-- the same answer for "no" and "not yet" is a guard that lies once per session,
-- silently, at the worst moment.
--
-- The cost on the tick is a call and a comparison per read, which is what the
-- guard was already doing plus the call. Nothing here allocates, and check.sh's
-- HOT list still holds every one of them to that.
local probe

-- The three that say something about a slot beyond whether a press would land.
-- Resolved to locals rather than looked up per button per tick, and
-- deliberately not in NEEDED: a client missing one of these loses a tint or a
-- ring, and a client missing anything in NEEDED loses the bar. Those are not
-- the same loss and must not share a switch.
--
-- None of the three is called by anything installed on this machine, which is
-- the bar the rest of the file is held to, so none is assumed.
local isCurrent, isRepeating, isEquipped

-- The two that say which spell a press would cast. Same tier as the three
-- above and for the same reason: a client missing either loses the two rungs
-- that know more than the client does, and keeps the bar.
--
-- GetMacroSpell is the one that was never asked for. GetActionInfo alone says
-- "macro" and stops there, which is where the honest answer used to end, and it
-- ends there on five of the twelve keys the warrior plan writes.
local readAction, macroSpell

-- Whether what is in a slot is aimed at an enemy. Same tier again: a client
-- without it loses the one rung that knows about the target with nothing
-- selected, and keeps the bar. Blizzard's own 2.5.6 API documentation lists it
-- under C_ActionBar with the loose name beside it, and nothing installed on
-- this machine calls either, so both are looked for.

--
-- The macro half is the whole reason this exists. GetActionInfo answers "spell"

-- wanted to know what a square held stopped at the second answer. The warrior
-- plan puts five of its twelve bar 1 keys in macros, so the gates that outrank
-- the client had a hole in them exactly where the loadout put things: an
-- Overpower in a macro drew ready all fight, and a Shield Bash in one drew
-- pressable with no shield on.
--
-- GetMacroSpell resolves a macro's conditionals to the spell the client would
-- actually cast, which is what draws the cooldown and the tooltip on Blizzard's
-- own macro buttons. Its return shape differs across clients, so all three are
-- read and the first thing that names a spell wins rather than a fixed index.
--
-- Never held against the slot. What a macro resolves to changes with the
-- cursor and with the target, so a memo keyed on the macro would be wrong
-- between one tick and the next; ns.SpellNameHeld holds the only part that is
-- stable, which is what a spell id is called.

-- IsUsableAction knows about your resources, your stance, your cooldowns and

-- colours the icon off that call alone, so a Flame Shock in an inn with
-- nothing selected draws white on their bar and drew ready on this one. The
-- range rung could not catch it, because with nothing targeted there is no
-- distance to be out of and it skips itself, and the condition rung only
-- speaks for the spells a class file names. Every other attack on the bar fell
-- through to ready.
--
-- The fact the client does hold is whether the slot is aimed at an enemy, and
-- an attack with nothing to attack is a press that does nothing. A spell that
-- is not harmful is left alone on purpose: a heal or a shield with nothing
-- selected lands on you under the self cast setting, and a totem has no target
-- at all, so for both of those the press does something and the square stays
-- ready.
--
-- Asked of the spell where a macro is what is in the slot, for the reason
-- Refused below asks ns.SpellUsable there, and of the slot for everything
-- else. A macro that resolves to no spell falls back to the slot, which is the
-- honest answer for a /startattack with no /cast in it. Both are read against
-- the target, as range is: a mouseover macro hovered over a mob with nothing
-- targeted is the one press this reads wrong, and it reads it grey rather
-- than lit.
--
-- Answers the fact rather than the status, because Slot.State hands it back to
-- the caller as well as reading it. Buttons/Bars.lua keeps it against the
-- square and asks about range on the tick only where it is true, which is what
-- turns a range check per square into a range check per attack.
