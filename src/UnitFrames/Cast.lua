--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The cast row under an enemy bar
--
-- `grep UNIT_SPELLCAST` returned nothing across this addon until this file.
-- The enemy bars replace the nameplate, and the one thing a nameplate says
-- that no bar here says is that a cast is running and there are two seconds
-- left to press Pummel. Replacing the plate cost that, so the replacement owes
-- it back.
--
-- No state. There is nothing to accumulate: ns.CastingInfo is a live question
-- with a live answer, so the tick asks it once per bar and this file draws
-- what came back. That is the difference between this and Swing/Swing.lua,
-- which has to reconstruct a clock the client does not keep. A cast bar built
-- on a model would need a model keyed by unit token, and nameplate tokens are
-- recycled the moment a mob dies, which is a whole class of stale bar this
-- file cannot have.
--
-- The row is the second chamber of the health bar's own box, not a box of its
-- own under it, and it takes no room at all while nothing is casting.
--
-- It began as a separate box: its own backdrop, its own four sided violet
-- outline, four pixels of gap. Two independently framed rectangles near each
-- other, with nothing but proximity saying they were about the same mob. One
-- outline round both and one dark line between them says it instead, and the
-- line is the cheaper claim: a seam reads as a division inside one object, a
-- gap reads as two objects.
--
-- The room it used to hold is the other half. The row was reserved whether or
-- not the mob ever cast, so seventeen pixels of nothing hung under every bar on
-- the screen, permanently. The goal that bought was right and is kept: a row
-- that appears must not shove the health bar upward at the exact moment the
-- thing you are watching starts happening, because a bar that moves when the
-- fight gets interesting is a bar you have to re-find. Reserving was only one
-- way to reach it, and it was the expensive way. The widget hangs by its top
-- edge now, so the chamber opens downward out of the box's bottom and every
-- pixel above it, the health gauge included, stays exactly where it was.
--
-- What is left when nothing is casting is not air. It is nothing: the box is
-- the health gauge and its hairline, and the bar is twelve pixels shorter.
--
-- Two things move on this row and they move at different rates, so they are
-- two functions. Cast.Update is what the client said and runs on the bars'
-- tick; Cast.Sweep is the moving edge and runs on every frame. See the note at
-- the head of Swing/Gauges.lua for why the second one is not on a ticker.

-- it replaces is one string built per tenth per casting mob for the rest of the
-- session: at fifteen plates in a raid that is a hundred and fifty throwaway
-- strings a second to draw about thirty distinct numbers, which is the shape
-- this addon has already caught on the list collector and on the level tag.
--
-- Keyed by the tenth rather than by the float, which is what makes it a cache
-- at all: there are ten values a second and not sixty.
--
-- Public, because the player's own cast bar draws the same number off the same
-- clock and a second table of the same thirty strings is a second table to keep
-- true. UnitFrames/PlayerCast.lua is the other caller.

-- What an unlocked frame draws instead of asking the client.
--
-- Public for the reason Cast.Seconds is: the player's own bar is empty just as
-- often and is placed the same way, by unlocking the frames and looking at it.
--
-- The row is empty almost all of the time, which makes "unlock the frames and

-- caster pulls you is one you cannot place, size or judge. Buffs/Nag.lua has
-- the same shape of problem and the same answer, and its preview mode is where
-- this idea comes from.
--
-- Five seconds, and both halves are drawn because the row draws two different
-- pictures. The first is a cast filling left to right and the second is a
-- channel draining right to left, so one unlock answers both questions.
--
-- Named in English like everything else this addon says in its own voice, and
-- named for what it is rather than after a spell. A row reading "Shadow Bolt"
-- over a boar that is not casting is a preview lying about the thing it is
