--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The block, and where it hangs
--
-- One square per unit frame: a portrait, a health gauge and a power gauge
-- inside one outline, drawn on a secure unit button this addon made. Everything
-- in here is a rectangle. Nothing in here reads a unit, and the tick that
-- paints what it built is UnitFrames/Paint.lua.
--
-- Every frame here is ours. It used to be a block drawn over Blizzard's own
-- PlayerFrame, with the client's portrait and bars pinned to rails of ours and
-- every number that crossed between the two scales converted and snapped, and
-- the file's header spent a page on that boundary. The boundary is gone. The
-- button, the portrait, the two bars, the four strings and the badges are all
-- created below, all on the pixel grid in UI/Pixel.lua, so a size written here
-- as 34 means 34 physical pixels, a hairline is one, and where the whole block
-- lands is a whole pixel too, because the frame it hangs off is ours as well.
--
-- Two frames per unit, and the split is the one UnitFrames/Group.lua makes.
-- The anchor is a plain frame that UI.Placeable drags and the settings remember;
-- the button is the secure unit button inside it, which carries the click, the
-- menu and the unit watch. A secure button cannot be moved by an addon in
-- combat, and neither can its parent, so everything below that writes a point
-- or a size asks ns.Blocked on the button first and hands a refusal back to
-- UnitFrames/Skin.lua, which carries it to the next PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED.

-- target of target under the target, and the pet beside the player.
--
-- A constant rather than the third pair of settings. The two big blocks stand
-- side by side and the number between them is a corridor somebody wants to
-- choose; a small block reads as one unit with the block it is parked on, and
-- three pixels is the hairline that keeps two adjacent outlines from reading
-- as one thick edge. There is no second value anyone would type.
local PARK_GAP = 3

-- How far the target's top edge drops below the player's. The range one may
-- land in, shared with `/wk skin level` through Skin.LinkRange so the slash
-- command, the panel and a dropped drag all clamp to the same numbers.
--
-- There is no horizontal number beside it. The distance across is the mirror,
-- and the mirror is not a preference: the target's facing edge is the player's
-- reflected in the middle of the screen, so the corridor is twice the player's
-- distance from the centre and dragging the player sets it.

-- UI/Draw.lua crops an icon at 5/64: a portrait is sampled art, and a crop
-- that lands between two texels makes the sampler interpolate across the whole
