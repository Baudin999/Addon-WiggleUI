-- One party or raid member's tile
--
-- A block of the person's class colour with their role at the left end and
-- their name beside it, and what they have lost dimmed at the right hand end
-- the way the player frame's own bar dims it. Nothing else: no number, no
-- second bar through the middle, no square bolted on the side. You read a tile
-- by how much of it is still the colour, which is a shape rather than a reading
-- and is what makes a wall of forty of them scannable at a glance.
--
-- This replaced a row that was the player block repeated, and the reason is
-- worth writing down. A party block that matched the skin was one gauge among
-- the six already on the screen, and in a raid it was forty gauges: the same
-- instrument the player frame is, at a size nobody can take a reading off,
-- forty times over. The tile is a different instrument on purpose. It is read
-- as an area and not as a length, and the two things it says are who and how
-- much, which are the only two questions a group frame is ever asked.
--
-- The missing end is the fill dimmed, which is what every other gauge in the
-- addon keeps behind its fill. It was bleached toward white and hatched for a
-- while, on the argument that a dimmed end reads as a second fill; on the
-- screen the hatch read as a stripe through the tile and the player frame next
-- to it dimmed, and two instruments saying "lost" two ways is one too many.
--
-- Nothing in here knows there is a header, an order or a raid, and nothing in
-- here reads a setting. What one tile is drawn from arrives as one table at
-- layout time, which is the same seam UnitFrames/Cast.lua sits on and is what
-- lets UnitFrames/Group.lua be about attributes and slots and nothing else.
--
-- Every widget write on the tick is guarded on the value already on the frame.
-- Forty of these on a raid at five ticks a second is where that stops being a
-- style rule and starts being the difference you can feel.
--
-- When a tile is drawn is the other half of that, and it is this file's too. A
-- tile registers three unit events against whichever token the header has its
-- button pointed at and marks itself when one arrives, so the pass over forty
-- of them draws the ones something happened to. What is left on the pass for
-- every tile is one UnitInRange, which is the one reading on here the client
-- has no event for.

-- the art readable from across the screen and hands the rest of the row back to
