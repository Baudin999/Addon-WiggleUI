-- The debuff row, as it ships, is not here.
--
-- Which debuffs matter is a spec question, so the list is a fact about your
-- spec and lives in Class\<yours>.lua under `debuffs`, which is the rule every
-- other part of the addon follows. Nothing in this file names a spell any more.
-- An arms warrior watches Rend, Deep Wound and Mortal Strike; a protection one
-- watches Sunder and wants the room back; an enhancement shaman applies none of
-- the five and used to be handed all of them anyway, because this list was one
-- constant and it was saved per account.
--
-- Rank 1 IDs in those files, because matching happens on the localised name:
-- every rank counts, another warrior's Sunder shows up, and one entry covers a
-- spell you will re-rank six times.
--
-- This is still the starting list and not the list. What a bar tracks is
-- ns.dbc.barsSpells, which the panel and `bars debuff` edit, because which
-- debuffs matter is a fight question as well as a spec one.

-- The most a bar will track. The aura scan is forty slots against every name on
-- the list, per mob, on every reading and on every aura the mob gains or loses,
-- and the row still has to fit above a
-- bar that is 120 pixels wide at its narrowest. Ten is past anything a warrior
-- applies and cheap enough not to be worth arguing about.
local MAX_SPELLS = 10

-- What the panel's picker offers is not here either, for the same reason and
-- with one addition: it is a class fact rather than a spec one, so it sits on
-- the class table under `suggested` and every spec of that class shares it. The
-- picker is a shortlist of what you could put on the row, and a fury warrior
-- who wants to watch Sunder for one fight should not have to type a number to
-- get at a spell his own class applies.
--
-- It is a shortlist and not a limit either way, because the panel also takes a
-- bare spell ID and so does `bars debuff add`. An ID this client cannot name is
-- dropped from the offer rather than shown as a blank row.
--
-- Every ID in those lists is the ID of the aura that lands on the mob, never
-- the ID of the spell or talent that applies it. For a ranked spell those are
-- the same thing and rank 1 covers every rank. For a proc and for a stun bolted
-- onto a charge they are two different spells with two different names, and the
-- one you find first is the wrong one. Deep Wounds is the case that got shipped
-- broken: 12162 is the talent, the picker offered it, and the square never lit
-- up once. See REPLACED below.

-- An ID this addon offered that no aura will ever carry, and the ID that works
-- in its place.
--
-- 12162 is the Deep Wounds talent. The client names it "Deep Wounds" and
-- ns.SpellName answers happily, so nothing looked wrong: the picker showed the
-- entry, the square drew, and it stayed dark through every fight. The aura that
-- actually lands is 12721, and the client calls that one "Deep Wound",
-- singular. Since the scan matches on the name, one letter was the whole bug.
--
-- Two doors have to be shut, not one. A saved list keeps whatever was already
-- in it, because the spec's own list is read once on a fresh character and
-- never again, so anyone who picked Deep Wounds before this fix still carries
-- the dead ID. And a bare number goes on through the panel's text field and
-- `bars debuff add`, where Wowhead's search for "deep wounds" still lands on
-- the talent first. So the swap happens at login and again inside AddSpell.

-- How often every bar is read off the client from the top, in seconds.
--
-- It was a fifth of a second, which is the rate every readout in this addon
-- runs at, and on this one it was a poll: thirty client calls per bar per pass
-- to find out that a mob nothing had happened to still had the same name, the
-- same level and the same debuffs. Fifteen plates made that about 2,400 calls a
-- second.
--
-- The client already says when a mob's health, auras, threat or target move,
-- and Attach registers for all four against the plate's own token. What is left
-- for a pass over everything is the part no event carries: a plate that should
-- no longer have a bar, the line saying who else is on the mob, and a client
-- that fires none of the four. A second is soon enough for all three.
local VERIFY = 1

-- One empty table handed back wherever the registry answers nothing, so a class
-- with no file and a client that has not said what you are both walk zero
-- entries instead of raising.
local NONE = {}

-- Pixels, not units.
--
-- Every widget here sits on the pixel grid in UI/Pixel.lua, where one unit is
-- one physical pixel, so these are the sizes the bar actually occupies on the
-- monitor and they are the same on every monitor. That is the point of the
-- grid and it is also the one thing it costs: a 21 pixel bar is a fifth of the
-- screen height on a laptop and a tenth of it on a 4K panel. `bars zoom` is the
-- answer to that, and it is a whole number because a fractional one would put
-- everything back on half pixels.
--
-- The icon's edge is ns.db.barsIconSize and only the gap between icons is
-- fixed, because the row is as long as the list now and the list is yours.
--
-- This used to say 16 and 32 were the two sizes with a right answer. They are
-- not, and the square has never been drawn at either of them, for two reasons
-- that both live in this part of the addon.
--
-- The square carries a one pixel border and the art is inset inside it, so a
-- 20 pixel setting draws 18 pixels of icon. And ns.UI.Icon crops five texels
-- off each edge to lose the border the client bakes into the art, so 54 texels
-- are sampled and not 64. The client keeps half sized copies and picks the pair
-- nearest what was asked for, so the exact sizes are the ones 54 halves down
-- to, which is 54 and 27 rather than 32 and 16.
--
-- Add the border back and the only setting in the 16 to 32 range that draws one
-- texel per pixel is 29. 20 draws 18 pixels from 54 texels, which is 58 percent
-- of the way between two stored copies and about as blended as it gets.
-- EnemyBars.IconAdvice is where that arithmetic lives, the panel and the slash
-- word both read it, and the harness checks the number it names is really
-- exact rather than trusting a comment.
local ICON_GAP = 4

-- What the square's edge may be set to. Named here rather than written into the
-- panel and the slash word separately, because EnemyBars.IconAdvice has to
-- search the same range those two offer or it will name a size neither reaches.
--
-- The ceiling is 56 rather than a round number. 54 texels survive the crop, the
-- border takes two pixels, so 56 is the largest square where a stored texel
-- still lands on a screen pixel. Above it the client is stretching a 54 texel
-- picture over more pixels than it has and the art goes soft again, so a higher
-- ceiling would only offer sizes that look worse than the one below them.
--
-- It was 32, which was chosen when the row was four fixed icons on a 180 pixel
-- bar. That put the whole top half of the useful range out of reach: `bars zoom`
-- did not work, so the only way to get a big icon was this number, and this
-- number stopped well short of one.
local ICON_MIN, ICON_MAX = 16, 56

-- Even, and that is the whole reason it is not 21. Replace centres the gauge on
-- the mob, so the offset is half the bar height, and half of 21 is half a pixel:
-- every bar the addon has drawn had its origin off a boundary and everything
-- inside it drawn across two rows. PlaceOnPlate rounded that away and gave up
-- half a pixel of centring. An even bar gives up nothing.

-- list of who else was on it, and the name, the health number and the level all
-- carried an outline UI/Text.lua says closes up a glyph's counters below 14.

--

-- to ns.UI.Flow now, and the widget's own height falls out of the measurement
-- rather than being derived by hand from four other numbers. What that bought,
-- beyond the length: the icon row wraps because the row node says wrap, not
-- because this function works out how many fit and anchors each square to the
-- gauge's corner with the row width subtracted.
--
-- The strings inside the gauge are still anchored by hand below the tree, and
-- the reason is the same for each: their size is whatever the mob happens to be
-- called or what level it is, so it is not known when the layout runs. A layout
-- that had to re-run on a name change would be a layout running on the tick.
-- See the note at the top of UI/Flow.lua.
--
-- Two conversions, and telling them apart is the whole of why `bars zoom` works
-- now and did not before.
--
-- `unit` turns a number from the constants above into the units this widget is
-- drawn in. On the grid it is 1: a design pixel is a unit, and the zoom on the
-- frame's scale is what makes that unit a 1x1, 2x2 or 3x3 block of screen
-- pixels. Off the grid, on a client with no SetIgnoreParentScale, it is the
-- fraction that keeps the bar the same physical size, which is as close as that
-- client gets.
--
-- `px` is one screen pixel, and it is for hairlines, insets and nothing else.
-- An edge is one pixel at every zoom, the same as every rule in the options
-- window. A design that grows does not want a border that grows with it.
--
-- Every size here used to go through `px`, including the ones that are sizes in
-- the design. On the grid that is a divide by the zoom, the frame's scale
-- multiplies it straight back, and the bar measured 180 by 62 screen pixels at
-- zoom 1, 2 and 3 alike. The setting had never done anything.
-- cold: places every region of one widget, on a rescale or a settings change.

-- The one region on a plate that goes in the attic rather than under ns.Strip.
--
-- Blizzard's plate cast bar is the same CastingBarFrame mixin the target's bar
-- is, and that mixin shows itself with SetShown. SetShown is resolved in C and
-- never reads the Lua Show that ns.Strip put a Hide in, so the bar came back on
-- the first cast of the session and stayed back for the rest of it: two cast
-- bars for one cast, ours on the plate and Blizzard's under it. That is the
-- same bug Core/BlizzHide.lua's header describes for the target's bar, on
-- the same mixin, found the same way.
--
-- Core/Attic.lua was the answer there and it is the answer here. A frame whose
-- parent is hidden is not drawn whatever the mixin calls on the frame itself,
-- and Attic.Sweep re-checks every caged frame once a second.
--
-- Only the cast bar. Everything in PlateRegions above is the plate's own art
-- and its health bar; nothing re-shows those, and the client anchors to them,
-- so caging them would take them out of the plate's chain to fix a bug they do
-- not have.
--
-- Read off the client's own XML rather than guessed. Both clients this addon
-- runs on, 2.5.6 and 1.15.9, declare the plate's cast bar as
-- `CastBarsContainer.castBar`: a container frame the health bar's container is
-- anchored under, with the bar inside it. That is the same shape PlateRegions
-- already reads the health bar through. The bare `castBar` this used to read
-- was a key neither client carries, so the lookup answered nil, nothing went
-- in the attic, and Blizzard's bar came up under the plate on the first cast
-- of every fight with `bars cast` on and the switch saying it was hidden. The
-- bare key stays as the second answer for a build that predates the container.
--
-- Only the bar, not the container. The client anchors the health bar to the
-- container, so caging it would move that anchor out of the plate's chain to
-- fix a bug the container does not have.
--
-- `every` is what Restore passes, for the reason PlateRegions takes one: a bar
-- caged while `bars cast` was on has to be handed back after the setting goes
-- off, and a list built from the setting would no longer have it to hand.

-- The cast events, and what they are and are not for.
--
-- They are not what the feature is built on. ns.CastingInfo is read again for
-- every bar on every reading, so a client that never fires one of these for a
-- nameplate unit draws exactly the same bar a second later. That is deliberate
-- after the Deep Wounds bug: a feature whose only source is an event nobody has
-- proved fires is a feature that draws nothing and says nothing.
--
-- What they buy is that second, and it is worth more than it was: the reading
-- behind them used to run five times as often. A cast that starts just after
-- one is most of a one and a half second window old before any bar admits it,
-- which is most of the reason to look.
--
-- Registered only while there is something to draw with them, because
-- registered they wake this frame on every cast every unit the client tracks
-- starts, which in a raid is a great many for the eight of them that land on a
-- mob with a bar. Rebuild is what turns them on and off, so a setting change
-- reaches them for free.
