--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The aura rows on the skinned frames
--
-- Two rows of squares under each block: what the unit is bleeding from, and
-- what is helping it. The player has a pair and so does the target. Ours, out
-- of C_UnitAuras with the UnitAura fallback every other aura reader in this
-- addon uses, drawn with UI/Aura.lua and laid out by ns.UI.Flow.
--
-- The client's own row is hidden, and that is the point of the file rather
-- than a side effect. UnitFrames/Skin.lua used to leave Blizzard's row where
-- it was and make room for it by fitting the target frame to the block plus a
-- measured lift, so the client's own arithmetic dropped the icons under the
-- block. That worked and it cost a measured lift, a UNIT_AURA handler waiting
-- for the first target carrying an aura to settle the number, a frame that was
-- not the same rectangle as the block, and a mouse region inset to pull clicks
-- off the strip underneath. All four are gone. The target frame is the block
-- exactly, like the other two.
--
-- The row could not be moved and that is why it had to be replaced. Every icon
-- in it is a child of a secure unit button, so an addon may anchor one out of
-- combat only, and the client re-anchors the head of each row on every aura the
-- target gains or loses. A row placed here would be back inside the gauge one
-- refresh into the first pull and stay there until it ended.
--
-- Hiding is a different question from anchoring and this file gets one answer
-- to it rather than assuming. The buttons go into Core/Attic.lua, the same place
-- every Blizzard frame this addon replaces goes, so a client that re-shows one
-- through SetShown gets nothing: the button's parent is hidden and cannot be
-- shown. The attic refuses on a protected region in combat and says so by
-- returning false, so a button the client builds mid fight is retried on the
-- next tick and lands the moment combat drops. Whether these buttons are
-- protected at all on this hybrid client is in the untested list in
-- docs/README.md, because the honest answer is that nobody has watched a target
-- gain its ninth debuff in a raid yet.
--
-- A button the client re-parents back out of the attic is caught by
-- ns.Attic.Sweep, which Core/BlizzHide.lua runs once a second over
-- everything the attic holds. Nothing here has to keep its own watch.
--
-- The player has the same two rows under its own block. That was left out of
-- the first build and it was the wrong call: the two blocks are one HUD now
-- that the target is the player mirrored, and what is on you belongs beside
-- what is on the target rather than in the top corner of the screen where the
-- client keeps it. The rows are the same rows, off the same settings, drawn by
-- the same code, which is the whole reason ROWS is a table keyed by frame.
--
-- The client's own buffs and debuffs are hidden the same way the target's are,
-- by name and one at a time, because BuffButton1 and DebuffButton1 are built
-- the same way on demand. Right click to cancel a buff comes back on your own
-- row, in combat too; see "Right click" below for how and for why the pet's
-- row cannot have it.
--
-- The temporary weapon enchant does come back, and it has to. It sits at no
-- aura index at all, so the walk below cannot find it and GetWeaponEnchantInfo
-- is the only call in the client that knows about it. Hiding the client's row
-- without it would take the last reading of the stone on your weapon off the
-- screen, and Buffs/Nag.lua only says when one is missing. Both hands go at the
-- head of your buff row, out of Buffs/Upkeep.lua so the three shapes that call
-- has had are counted in one place.
--
-- So the client's own enchant buttons go too, and they were left up for one
-- release. TemporaryEnchantFrame was deliberately spared while the enchant was
-- the one thing on you nothing here drew; the moment the row started drawing
-- it, sparing the client's copy stopped being a reading of the stone and
-- became a second one, in the top corner, under a square saying the same
-- number. That is the rule the whole file is built on: an aura the addon draws
-- has exactly one place on the screen.
--
-- They are swept as a run of their own rather than appended to the buff row's
-- names, because the two runs do not fill together. The sweep stops at the
-- first name the client has not built, and the client builds BuffButton6 only
-- once you carry six buffs, so a single list of both would stop short of the
-- enchants on every character who has ever had fewer buffs than the ceiling.

-- stops being readable. The ceiling is the block's own height, above which a
-- square is taller than the frame it hangs off, and that is `/wk skin height`
-- rather than the constant it was written as: the block was 34 pixels tall
-- when this file was new and it is a setting that runs to 72.
local SIZE_MIN, SIZE_CEILING = 12, 72

local TIMER_CEILING, COUNT_CEILING = 14, 11

-- Which rows a skinned frame gets, by the key UnitFrames/Skin.lua's SPECS uses.
--
-- Debuffs under the block and buffs over it, on both frames. The two rows do
-- not chain and neither can push the other about, which is the whole reason
-- they are on opposite sides: a target picking up a raid's worth of bleeds
-- moves nothing that was already on your screen.
--
-- Which way each one runs is not in this table, because it is not a property of
-- the row. It comes off the block's mirror in Auras.Place: both pairs start on
-- the gauge end, the edge that faces the other block, and run outward from
-- there. So your rows run right to left and the target's run left to right, and
-- the four of them read outward from the corridor in the middle of the screen
-- the way the two blocks already do.
--
-- How long a row runs is not in this table either, and it is not a setting any
-- more. A row draws every aura the client reports, up to the client's own
-- ceiling, and wraps away from the block when a line fills. It was a count,
-- shipped at eight, and eight is exactly one line of the block the addon
-- ships: a raid's worth of buffs stopped at the end of the line and the ninth
-- was simply not on the screen. A cap on a row that wraps buys nothing, and
-- the switch that takes the rows off is `/wk skin auras`.
--
--   filter    what the client calls this half of the aura list
--   head      the client's own button names, which are what gets hidden. The
--             pet's rows have none: the client's pet debuffs are children of
--             PetFrame, and Core/BlizzHide.lua takes that down whole
--   max       what the client calls its own ceiling, asked of the client
--             first so a backport that raised it is followed rather than
--             argued with
--   ceiling   how many of those the client will ever build, for a client
--             that does not carry the global above
--   enchants  put the temporary weapon enchants at the head of this row,
--             which only your own buffs can be, because they are the one
--             thing on you that no aura index answers for. It is also what
--             hides the client's own enchant buttons, and that is one flag
--             rather than two on purpose: drawing them here is the whole of
--             the reason we are allowed to take the client's copy down
--   hides     the switch that takes the client's copy of this row off the
--             screen. Three of them across the four rows, because the target's
--             buffs and debuffs are one row of icons over one frame and nobody
--             wants half of it
--   secure    lay the client's secure aura header over this row, so a right
--             click cancels the buff under it in combat as well as out of
--             it. Only your own buffs, because the client cancels nothing on
--             any other unit; see "Right click" below
--   global    what this row is called, for the reason UnitFrames/Skin.lua
--             names the block: a row that lands in the wrong place can then be
--             measured from a macro or from the harness without this file

--
-- These rows are the only reader in the addon that takes an icon off the aura
-- rather than off a spell it already knows: the enemy bars draw the list you

-- a target carrying a raid's worth of bleeds is the garbage that shows up as a
-- stutter rather than as a number. Where only the new call exists the table is
-- made and dropped, which is the cost of that client.
--
-- The positional read of UnitAura is the only way that call can be read on
-- 2.5.6: name is first, the icon second, the stack count third, the duration
-- fifth, the expiry sixth, the caster seventh and the spell tenth.
--
-- The duration comes back with the expiry and is the sweep's half of the
-- answer. The expiry alone says when the aura ends and nothing about how much

-- carry nine buffs, and never before. So this cannot be a walk done once at
-- style time, and it must not be a walk of all ninety-six names on every tick
-- either.
--
-- It is neither. The buttons are built in order, so the only one that can have
-- appeared since the last look is the one after the last one hidden. That is a
-- single global lookup per run per pass once the run has settled, and a run of
-- them the first time a unit turns up with a full list.
--
-- A run is one name the client counts from 1, and a row can replace more than
-- one of them: your buff row stands in for BuffButton and for TempEnchant

-- that walked them as one list would stop at the first BuffButton the client
-- has not built and never reach the enchants at all.
--
-- A name this client does not use costs nothing and hides nothing, which is

-- Right click
--
-- A right click on one of your buffs takes it off, in combat as well, which is
-- what the client's own buff frame does and the one thing these squares
-- dropped when they replaced it. The squares cannot do it themselves: the
-- cancel is refused to an addon in combat. So your buff row carries the
-- client's own mechanism over it, out of UI.Press.Cancels: a secure header
-- that hands each of its buttons the index of one of your buffs from secure
-- code, and buttons whose right click cancels that index. They are invisible.
-- The squares underneath are what you see, and the buttons are what you touch.
--
-- Two things have to agree for that to be honest, and both are held here.
--
-- The order. The header walks your buffs in the client's own order, enchants
-- first, and nothing about its sort is Lua this addon can change. So a secure
-- row is drawn in that order too, rather than yours first, which is Scan's one
-- concession: button 3 cancels aura 3, and square 3 has to be aura 3.
--
-- The grid. The header lays its buttons out from four numbers, and Flow lays
-- the squares out from the row's width and gap. Place works the four numbers
-- out from the same width and gap with Flow's own line-breaking rule, so each
-- button lands on its square's art, and the aura section in the harness
-- measures that it does.
--
-- Only yours. The client's cancel is written against the player and nothing
-- else, and CancelUnitBuff answers "pet" by doing nothing, which is what the
-- live client did when this shipped for the pet. So the pet's squares answer
-- no click, the same as the client's own pet frame.
--
-- The header is protected, so where it sits, how big its buttons are and
-- whether it is shown are written out of combat only. A change that arrives in
-- a fight is remembered and written on the first pass after it, the way every
-- other half of the skin that a lockdown can turn down is.
