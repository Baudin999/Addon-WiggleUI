-- The party and the raid
--
-- Our own frames, built from SecureGroupHeaderTemplate, rather than Blizzard's
-- frames wearing our skin.
--
-- UnitFrames/Skin.lua skins the player, target and target of target because
-- those three carry targeting, the dropdown and a cast bar, and a frame drawn
-- from scratch would have to earn all of that back. That argument does not
-- carry over. PartyMemberFrame1 is bound to party1 in XML and there is no
-- supported way to point it at anyone else, so the moment the order is decided
-- by role rather than by party index, the client's frames cannot draw it. The
-- raid is worse: CompactRaidFrameContainer runs its own layout pass and puts
-- back whatever an addon moves.
--
-- SecureGroupHeaderTemplate is the answer the client already ships. It makes
-- one secure unit button per member, watches each one, and shows and hides them
-- itself as the roster changes. Every attribute that decides the shape of the
-- list is written out of combat and the header does the rest.
--
-- Two lists, not one
--
-- A party and a raid are two things you place, size and read differently, and
-- this file shipped once with one header serving both. That was wrong in the
-- way that costs an afternoon: one place on the screen, one block size, one set
-- of columns and one handle, so a party wide enough to read health off was a
-- raid that ran past the edge of the monitor, and there was no way to put the
-- two of them in different places because there was only ever one of them.
--
-- So everything below takes a list as its first argument, and there are two:
-- the party, four or five tiles in a line, and the raid, a grid of one group
-- per run with the group number on each. Each has its own header, its own place
-- on the screen, its own sizes and its own preview. The header attributes are
-- what keep them out of each other's way: the party shows in a party and never
-- in a raid, the raid shows in a raid and never in a party, so at most one of
-- them is ever drawing.
--
-- A run and a stack, not a row and a column
--
-- Both lists are laid out in one vocabulary: a run is the members of one group
-- in a line, and the stack is how those runs sit against each other. Which of
-- the two is horizontal is one setting, `grow`, and everything that has to know
-- asks Across. A raid running across is five to a row and a row per group,
-- which is the shape Classic's raid actually has and what the grid ships as;
-- running down it is the transpose, a column per group, for a grid against a
-- screen edge. The party is one run of everybody and the same switch turns it
-- from a line across the screen into a line down it.
--
-- Three things follow from the header being secure, and they are most of this
-- file:
--
--   Every attribute write is refused in combat and owed to the end of the
--   fight through ns.Lockdown.
--
--   A button the header has just made cannot be laid out until combat drops,
--   because it is protected. That costs nothing in practice: the header defers
--   its own update in lockdown too, so there is no new button to lay out until
--   the fight ends either.
--
--   The size of one button has to be written from inside the header's own
--   restricted environment, because the header reads it while placing the
--   column. That is initialConfigFunction, and it is the only snippet in this
--   file. It sets a size and two attributes and nothing else, so it needs
--   nothing from the restricted whitelist that is in any doubt.
--
-- The party's order is tanks, then healers, then damage, and by name inside a
-- band. By name is arbitrary as an ordering and it is the only one that is
-- stable: the same five people produce the same five slots in every group they
-- are ever in together, whoever formed it and whoever zoned in first. Party
-- index does not do that, and sorting by class does not either, because a class
-- can be two roles. The raid runs the same bands or the raid's own group
-- numbers, which is what somebody with assignments per group wants.
--
-- It is recomputed out of combat and nowhere else, which is what makes fixed
-- placing true rather than aspirational. An inspect that resolves mid pull is
-- recorded by Unit/Role.lua and changes nothing on the screen until the fight
-- ends.

-- client's SECURE_ACTIONS table and only one of them is a path the client
-- walks: SecureTemplates.lua carries `togglemenu` under the comment "Unused by
-- Blizzard code but retained because the type attribute can be set from
-- addons". `menu` is what SecureUnitButton_OnLoad writes on every unit frame
-- the client builds, and it runs the function under the `menu-function`

--

-- have to remember and a table is one the file enforces. `mine` is whether your
-- own block is in the list: off in a party, where Skin.lua already draws you,
-- and on in a raid, where a grid missing exactly one person is a grid you have

-- Where the list sits
--
-- The frame you drag is the list's own rectangle, all of it. That is the other

-- single block somewhere inside whatever was drawn, so moving a raid meant
-- finding a hidden square in the middle of a grid first. Unlocked, the whole
-- list takes the mouse.
--
-- It is anchored by its middle, whatever corner a drag ends on, and that is
-- what makes a list fill outward from where you put it: two people and twenty
-- five are centred on the same pixel, and nobody joining moves anybody who was
-- already on the screen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The header hung off the list's own growth edge.
--
-- The one offset here is the header's own quirk: the first block of the first
-- group is anchored across the middle of the header on the axis the groups
-- stack along, so a list of several groups has to be pushed back by half of
-- everything past the first one, or the grid hangs off the far end of the
-- rectangle it was measured for. Which axis that is follows which way the
-- members run, and a list of one group needs none of it, because half of
-- nothing is nothing and both branches say so on their own.

-- because a list that grew off a corner would shove everybody along the moment
-- somebody joined. The corner is what gets written, because a rectangle of odd

-- The preview
--
-- A list with nobody in it is what you are placing every time you place it: the
-- party is empty out of a group and the raid is empty except on the nights it
-- is not. So unlocked, each list with nobody to draw stands people who are not
-- there in the slots real ones would take, in its own place and at its own
-- size. Both at once, because they are two frames and where you want each of
-- them is a question about the other. That is the answer
-- UnitFrames/PlayerCast.lua gives for a cast bar and it is the same reason:
-- what you are placing is invisible almost every time you place it.
--
-- Ordinary frames rather than anything the header made. A secure header shows
-- one button per member and there is no member, so a preview built out of its
-- buttons is a preview of nothing. They are built the first time somebody
-- unlocks and kept after that, because unlocking is not a thing done on a tick
-- and a player who unlocks once will do it again.
