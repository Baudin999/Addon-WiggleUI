-- The player frame, the target frame and target of target, drawn by this
-- addon: flat fills, one pixel edges, a square portrait, and the class colour
-- on the gauge and on the frame around it.
--
-- They are our own frames. For a long time they were Blizzard's three frames
-- wearing this look, because a frame drawn from scratch would have to earn
-- back the click, the menu and the cast bar, and would fight the Edit Mode
-- layout the addon carried for a client that turned out not to have Edit Mode
-- at all. That left three frames nobody could move. UnitFrames/Group.lua had
-- already shown the shape of the answer: a secure unit button of ours carries
-- the click and the menu through two attributes, the client's unit watch puts
-- it up and down with the unit, and UI.Placeable drags it the way every other
-- piece of this HUD is dragged. Blizzard's own three go to the attic through
-- the switch in Core/BlizzHide.lua, like every other frame this addon
-- replaces.
--
-- Three files behind this one, each with one subject:
--
--   UnitFrames/Block.lua is the geometry: the square, the two bars, the four
--   strings, the badges, and where the three blocks hang off each other.
--
--   UnitFrames/Paint.lua is the tick: given a block that already exists, read
--   the unit and write what changed.
--
--   UnitFrames/Auras.lua is the two aura rows on each of the first two.
--
-- What is left is this file, and it is the part rather than any of the three.
-- Building the three frames, whether each one is wanted, showing and hiding
-- them in the order that survives combat, placing them, and what the slash
-- commands and the panel are told. It owns the entry list, so it is the only
-- file that can answer which block a link or a perch hangs off, and it hands
-- that answer to Block rather than letting Block go looking.
--
-- It also owns when a block is drawn. Unit events mark a block and the pass
-- draws what is marked; see the note over WATCHED for which and why they are
-- safe to trust on this client.

-- How often the three blocks are looked at, and how often they are read off the

--
-- The client already says when a unit's health, power, auras or connection
-- move, so a frame is marked by Watched below and this pass draws what is
-- marked. What it costs when nothing has happened is the walk.
--

-- heal, a mob somebody else has tagged, and target of target, which has no
-- event stream of its own on this client beyond UNIT_TARGET on its host.

-- UNIT_NAME_UPDATE and UNIT_PORTRAIT_UPDATE, PlayerFrame.lua takes UNIT_LEVEL
-- and UNIT_FACTION, TargetFrame.lua takes UNIT_AURA and PartyMemberFrame.lua
-- takes UNIT_CONNECTION. A frame that draws what the client's own frame draws
-- may listen to what the client's own frame listens to.
--
-- Marked rather than drawn, because a unit taking four hits between two frames
-- is four events and one block. The pass a fifth of a second later draws what
-- is marked, which is the rate this part has always redrawn at.
