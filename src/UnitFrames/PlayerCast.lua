-- Your own cast bar
--
-- The last thing on this screen that was still Blizzard's. Every unit around
-- you is drawn by this addon and the one bar you are timing a press against
-- was a 2007 gold frame sitting under a HUD that has none, which is the single
-- loudest mismatch left in the interface.
--
-- A bar of its own rather than a chamber under the player block, and that is
-- the whole design decision in this file. The enemy row opens downward out of
-- the bar it belongs to because a mob's cast is one more thing about that mob.
-- Yours is not: under the player block is where your debuff row hangs, and a
-- chamber opening there would push that row down and pull it back up on every
-- cast, which is the row moving every time the fight gets interesting. So this
-- is furniture, placed once by dragging it, the same as the swing bars and the
-- meters. It ships under them on purpose. Charge icon, swing bars, cast bar is
-- one column of things you time a press against, and they read as one
-- instrument because they are the same width.
--
-- Almost nothing here is a second opinion about what a cast is.
-- UnitFrames/Cast.lua already owns four answers and this file asks it for all
-- of them: whether there is a cast worth drawing, how far along it is, what
-- the seconds left say, and what an unlocked frame previews. That file draws
-- the same cast in a different rectangle, and the two cannot disagree about a
-- channel draining backwards or about a bar sitting full for a fifth of a
-- second after the cast ended, because neither of them decides it.
--
-- What is this file's own is the half a mob's cast bar has no use for: the one
-- that failed. Interrupted, moved out of, or refused, your cast stops and the
-- bar goes red and holds for most of a second rather than vanishing, because a
-- cast that disappeared and a cast that finished look identical on a bar that
-- only ever empties. On a warrior that is Slam, which is the one cast in the
-- rotation and the one Swing/Slam.lua exists to time, so it is worth the hold.
--
-- Two rates, the same split every moving bar in this addon has. The client is
-- asked five times a second and again on every cast event, which is what puts
-- a bar up; the fill and the seconds move on every frame. See the head of
-- Swing/Gauges.lua for why the second one is not on a ticker.
