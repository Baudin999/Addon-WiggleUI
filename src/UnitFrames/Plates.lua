-- Where the client puts a nameplate, how far out, and what takes the click
--
-- Bars piling on top of each other when two mobs stand together is not a
-- drawing bug and no amount of care in the widget fixes it. The client decides
-- where a plate goes, and it decides using three things this addon can reach
-- and one it cannot.
--
-- The one it cannot is the world. Plates follow mobs, and mobs stand where they
-- stand.
--
-- The three it can:
--
--   nameplateMotion   0 lets plates overlap freely, 1 makes the driver push
--                     them apart. On 0 there is no avoidance to tune and
--                     nameplateOverlapV below changes nothing, which is why
--                     this is the first thing the part takes.
--   the plate's size  the driver spaces plates by how big it thinks a plate is,
--                     and it thinks a plate is Blizzard's nameplate. Ours is
--                     twice the height of that, and taller again while a mob
--                     is casting, so two plates the driver has cleanly
--                     separated are two bars that are not. The figure sent is
--                     the casting height: spacing for the taller of two
--                     states is right in both and for the shorter, neither.
--   nameplateMaxDistance
--                     how many yards out the client bothers to put a plate up.
--                     Nothing this addon draws can appear before that does: a
--                     bar is a child of a plate, so the range the bars work at
--                     is this CVar's and nothing else's.
--
-- SetNamePlateEnemySize tells it the real figure. Where that call is missing,
-- nameplateOverlapV multiplies the height the driver uses instead, which gets
-- the spacing right and leaves the click target where it was.
--
-- The plate's size is applied whenever the bars are drawn on plates, and not
-- only when `bars stack` is on, because it is two jobs and only one of them is
-- spacing. The other is the click: the frame the game hit-tests is the plate's
-- own, our bar is drawn over it and takes no mouse of its own, so a plate the
-- size of Blizzard's nameplate under a bar twice its height is a bar that
-- targets in the middle and does nothing at the ends. The figure sent is the
-- one UnitFrames/EnemyBars.lua measures: the smallest box centred where the
-- plate is that holds the whole bar. `bars stack` keeps the two CVars, which
-- are the half that is really about spacing.
--
-- A bigger plate does swallow more of a camera drag, which is the trade `bars
-- camera` and `bars clickthrough` manage.
--
-- All four are the player's, borrowed. Turning a setting off puts back what
-- was there, the same way Targeting/Aim.lua hands its own CVars back.

--
-- Asking matters because on the Anniversary client the ceiling is 41 and 41 is
-- also the default, so a setting that let the player walk up to 60 was a
