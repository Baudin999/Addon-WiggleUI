-- The bar on the screen, and the key that puts it there
--
-- Three protected things per bar, and a snippet stands between the player and
-- each of them, because every one is refused to an addon in a fight and a bar
-- of totems is pressed in one.
--
--   Showing it. A frame with a secure button inside it may not be shown or
--   hidden by an addon under lockdown. The key is bound to a UI/Press.lua
--   key, and the button's own snippet is what shows or
--   hides the bar: the same shape Character/Window.lua uses for the C key on a
--   sheet with nineteen secure squares on it. The key is held rather than
--   pressed. The down edge shows the bar and the up edge puts it away, which is
--   how every ring addon on this client reads a key, and it is why the button
--   takes both edges instead of toggling on one.
--
--   Hiding it after a press. A press on a square casts the spell, and the bar
--   is meant to go away again the way an OPie ring does. The button's OnClick
--   is wrapped, and the snippet that runs after the cast hides the bar the
--   button sits on. WrapScript is what OPie does to every ring proxy on this
--   client, so it is proven here in the way Blizzard parity asks for.
--
--   Moving it. The restricted environment has no StartMoving, so a secure
--   frame is placed by a point handed to a snippet; UI/Placeable.lua owns that
--   drag and the character sheet is its first caller. A bar is its second, and
--   the drag is taken by a grip along the bar's left edge rather than by the
--   bar, because the bar is squares from edge to edge and a drag started on a
--   square is a drag of what the square holds.
--
-- Everything else about a square is UI/Ability.lua's and Buttons/Castable.lua's:
-- the picture, the swipe, the colour of the edge, the ladder that decides it.
-- Nothing here reads an action slot, because nothing here has one.
--
-- The frames are made on first use and never destroyed, because a secure frame
-- cannot be. A bar you delete keeps its frame and the next bar you add takes
-- it, so the pool never grows past the cap, and every attribute on it is
-- written again from the list on every Apply, which is what makes a deleted
-- bar's key land on the right frame.

-- is what stops that edge reading as a mistake.
local GAP, PAD = 2, 4

-- 27, the sharp size, for the reason Buttons/Look.lua gives at length: it is
-- the one drawn size where a stored texel lands on a pixel. The zoom is how you
-- make a bar bigger, and it scales the whole frame rather than resampling the
-- art inside it, which is why the default zoom in AdHoc/Feature.lua is not 1:
-- a bar you hold a key to read wants a square you can read at a glance, and
-- scaling the frame is the only way to get one that keeps the art sharp.
local SIZE = 27

-- The grip along the left edge, in units. Wide enough to land a cursor on and
-- no wider, because it is on the screen only while the bar is. It is painted

-- second press to put the bar away, and a bar of totems is opened in a fight
-- with a thumb that is already going somewhere else.
--
-- The nil arm is not dead code. Nothing installed on this box hands a snippet
-- that third argument, so it is the client's word and not a proven call, and a
-- client that hands over nothing would otherwise leave the key showing a bar
-- that never goes away. On that client the key is the toggle it used to be,
-- which is worse than a hold and better than a bar you cannot dismiss.
