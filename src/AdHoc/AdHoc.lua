-- Bars you made yourself
--
-- A bar is a name, a key and a list of what you dragged onto it. On the screen
-- it is a ring that is up only while the key is held, so a bar of your trade
-- skills lives under T and a bar of totems under Shift-T, and neither is on the
-- screen while you fight.
--
-- This file is the list and nothing else. It knows what a bar holds and what
-- the cursor is carrying; it does not know what a frame is. Bars.lua builds the
-- frames, the squares and the keys off this list, and Panel.lua draws the page
-- you design a bar on. The split is what makes the rules assertable: a list you
-- can read in a harness without a screen is a list whose rules can be checked
-- without drawing anything.
--
-- Everything is per character. A trade skill is the character's, a totem is the
-- class's, and a bar of either written into the account would be a bar of
-- spells another character does not know.
--
-- A square holds a spell by name and never by id. `/cast Frost Shock` with no
-- rank named casts the best rank you know, so a bar never goes stale after a
-- trainer visit; Buttons/Ranks.lua exists to give the action bars that same
-- property and a bar built here gets it for free. Hover/Hover.lua makes the
-- argument at length. An item is held by name for the same reason, with its id
-- beside it because the cooldown call wants a number. A macro is held by name
-- because a macro index moves every time you make or delete one.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Six bars is the cap and sixteen squares is the most one ring holds. Both are caps
-- rather than sizes: a bar carries only what you put on it, and a cap that is
-- reached says so rather than dropping the seventh bar or the seventeenth
-- square on the floor. Six because the keys a bar wants are the letters left
-- over after the client's own, and sixteen because a shaman owns more totems
-- than a bar of twelve would hold.
