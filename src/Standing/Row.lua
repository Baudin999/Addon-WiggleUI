--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The row
--
-- One square per slot your class owns, in the order the plan writes them, in
-- the same place every time. Standing.lua says what is in each one and this
-- file decides when the row is on the screen and what a square looks like.
--
-- Four decisions, and each one is the row rather than a detail of it.
--
-- The empty slots are drawn. That is the opposite of what the client does and
-- it is the whole feature: Blizzard's row is as long as the number of totems
-- you have out, so the square in the second place is a different totem every
-- time you glance at it and the row has no shape to learn. Four fixed places
-- have one, and after a week the answer to "where is my Windfury" is a
-- position rather than a name. It also means the row says the thing a shifting
-- row cannot say at all, which is what is missing.
--
-- An empty slot is told apart by its colour and by nothing else. There is no
-- caption under the row and no letter on the square: the element is a colour on
-- the hairline, learned once, and four short words under four squares would be
-- more text than the row has information. Which colour is which is the class
-- file's to say, because a stance row will hand this one three different
-- colours and this file has no opinion about either set.
--
-- It is up in a fight, and out of one only while something is still standing.
-- That is the cooldown row's rule rather than the buff nag's, and for the same
-- reason: what is up is a question you ask again thirty seconds later, so a row
-- that appeared the moment something went wrong would arrive exactly when you
-- had stopped needing it. Everything down and no fight is the resting state and
-- the row is not there for it, because a row of four holes over your character
-- while you walk to the next pull is furniture. `/wui totems idle on` keeps it
-- up anyway.
--
-- Built out of UI\Aura.lua rather than UI\Ability.lua, which is the one choice
-- here that is not obvious. A totem is not a press. It has no cost, no range
-- and no stance, its sweep fills as it runs out rather than emptying as it
-- comes back, and the number over it is the thing you actually read. That is
-- the aura square's whole vocabulary and none of it is the ability square's.

local FRAME_NAME = "WiggleUIStanding"

-- 27, and the same number for the same reason Buffs\Nag.lua and

-- left resample exactly onto 54 pixels or onto 27 and nothing in between.
local ICON = 27
local GAP = 4

-- What the two numbers on a square may not grow past, which is UI\Aura.lua's
-- argument rather than this file's: a fourteen pixel timer over a sixteen pixel
-- icon covers the art it is annotating. The same pair the aura rows under the
-- unit frames pass, so a totem's seconds and a debuff's seconds are the same
-- size at the same square size.

local events, tick

-- What Place last laid out, so a tick that changes nothing does no work. The
-- three values are the cooldown row's three and carry that file's reasoning:

--
-- The square is a picture and a number, which between them say what is there

-- two fires and one glance.
