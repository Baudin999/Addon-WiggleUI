-- thing somebody will want and is otherwise a second setting to reach it. The
-- top is a solid bar, because the row it sits behind is outlined text and stays
-- readable on one, and a player on a bright floor asking for a solid bar has
-- already decided.
--
-- Fives, so the panel's stops and a macro's are the same twenty one values.
-- Command.Step refuses anything off them rather than rounding it, for the
-- reason it refuses a fractional zoom.
