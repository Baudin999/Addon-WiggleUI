--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The two panes
--
-- A clear background, on purpose and not as a default anyone is expected to
-- change. Details draws a window: a title bar, a frame, a backdrop, a resize
-- grip and a row of buttons, and the reason it needs all of that is that it is
-- a tool you go and use. This is not that. It is two columns of numbers you
-- read out of the corner of your eye during a pull, and every pixel of chrome
-- around them is a pixel of the fight it is standing on.
--
-- So there is no window. There are rows, each with a class coloured bar as
-- long as that player's share of the top one, and the bars are the only
-- surface drawn at all. The text is outlined rather than shadowed, which is
-- what UI/Text.lua's default flag is for and the reason it exists: these
-- glyphs sit over the world and a drop shadow disappears against a dark floor.
--
-- Both panes are children of one frame, so dragging either drags both and
-- there is one saved anchor rather than two to keep beside each other.
--
-- Mouse. The frame takes the mouse only while it is unlocked, for the same
-- reason the charge button does: a mouse enabled frame swallows every button
-- that lands on it, including the right button drag that turns the camera, and
-- this sits in the part of the screen where that drag starts. The one
-- exception is the damage pane's header, which opens the breakdown on the left
-- button and swaps DPS for HPS on the right, and is sixteen pixels tall. A
-- control you are meant to click has to be clickable while the frame it is on
-- is locked, or it is not a control.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

local FRAME_NAME = "WarriorKitMeter"

-- Every one of these is a unit, and a unit is one physical pixel at zoom 1 and
-- a whole block of them at any higher whole zoom. Nothing here is multiplied by
-- ns.Pixel: the frame is on the grid, so the numbers below are what gets drawn.
-- The icon first, because every other number here follows it.
--
-- 27, and not a number anyone picked for looking right. The client stores a
-- spell icon at 64 texels, the crop in UI/Draw.lua takes the five texel border
-- off each edge, and 54 are left to sample. A draw is exact only where those 54
-- halve down onto whole pixels, which is 54 and 27 and nothing in between, and
-- ns.UI.IconSizes is where that list comes from. Drawn at 12, which is what
-- this shipped as for about an hour, the renderer blends the 27 copy and the
-- 13.5 copy and the result is mush.
--
-- At zoom 1 this draws 27 from the half size copy and at zoom 2 it draws 54
-- from the full one, which is the sharpest a spell icon gets. Zoom 3 draws 81
-- and is blended; the panel says so rather than pretending otherwise.

local PANE_GAP = 8  -- the damage pane to the threat pane

-- Font sizes, in pixels, because inside a frame on the grid a font size is a
-- pixel height rather than a point.
--
-- Every string on the meter is outlined and every one of them has to be, which
-- is what sets the floor under both of these numbers.
--
-- The meter has no background. The outline is the only thing between a number
-- and a pale floor behind it, so unlike a timer on a debuff square this text
-- cannot trade the rim for a shadow: a shadow needs a known colour to be darker
-- than and the world is not one. ns.UI.NumberFont makes that trade at every
-- size and is deliberately not used here for that reason.
--
-- What that leaves is a hard minimum. An outline costs a pixel on every stroke,
-- and below ns.UI.OutlineFloor a 3 and an 8 stop being different shapes. Both
-- sizes below sit at the floor rather than near it, and the harness reads the
-- floor from UI/Text.lua rather than carrying its own copy of the number.
--
-- Both of these were under it at first, 11 on a row and 12 on a header, and the
-- report from the client was that the meter was not sharp. It was not soft. It
-- was closed up.

-- the meter is allowed to be. A row that has been built is kept, because a
-- frame cannot be destroyed on this client and a pool that shrank with the
-- slider would leak a row every time it went back up.
local MAX_ROWS = 10

-- How faint a bar is, as a fraction, out of the whole percent the setting
-- holds. Low enough to read the world through and high enough to tell four
-- classes apart at a glance, which is the whole job.
--
-- It was a constant here, and the argument for the number it was set to still
-- stands and is now the default rather than the only answer. It was 0.32 first,
-- and 0.32 is a wash rather than a tint: the top row's bar is the full width of
-- the pane by definition, so whatever this number is, the number one player is
-- a solid rectangle of class colour across the meter every tick, and at a third
-- alpha that rectangle is the brightest thing on that part of the screen. At
-- 0.15 the rank still reads at a glance, because a bar is read against the bars
-- beside it and not against the world behind it, and the world behind it comes
-- through.
--
-- What made it a setting is the half of that the addon cannot see. The right
-- alpha depends on what is behind the meter, and what is behind the meter is
-- the zone: 15 over a night time crypt floor is the tint this was drawn for and
-- 15 over Tanaris at noon is nothing at all. No number this file picks is right
-- on both, and a player looking at one of them can tell in a second.
--
-- Called from the two places a bar's colour is written, never from a tick:
-- BuildRow runs once per row and PaintRow's write sits behind its class guard.
