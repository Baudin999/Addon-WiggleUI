-- Threat on what you are looking at
--
-- The client already does the hard half. UnitDetailedThreatSituation's third
-- return is threat scaled against the amount needed to take the mob off
-- whoever is holding it: 100 means this player pulls, and the client has
-- already folded in the melee and ranged thresholds, the tank's own total and
-- every talent that moves either. Nothing here recomputes any of that. It
-- samples that one number per member and per pet, and does two things the
-- client will not.
--
-- It sorts, so the pane is a list rather than five separate questions.
--
-- And it differentiates. A percentage tells you where someone is; the rate of
-- change tells you where they are going, and where they are going is the whole
-- point of watching threat at all. 82% and falling is a rogue who stopped;
-- 82% and climbing four points a second is a rogue who takes the mob in four
-- and a half seconds, and you would like to know that now rather than then.
--
-- The rate is smoothed, because the raw one is unusable. Threat arrives in
-- lumps the size of a Sinister Strike and the denominator is a tank whose own
-- total steps up every swing, so two consecutive samples can differ by twenty
-- points in either direction. What is wanted is the trend across the last
-- couple of seconds, which is what an exponential average of half second
-- deltas is.
--
-- On a client with no threat API this whole file answers nothing and the pane
-- says so. Vanilla computes no threat at all, which is why every Classic
-- threat meter is a combat log simulation with a table of every spell's
-- coefficient in it. That is a different addon, and a wrong number here is
-- worse than an honest blank.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
