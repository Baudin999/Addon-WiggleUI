-- Where you stand on it, on any tooltip in the addon
--
-- The threat pane in Meter/Window.lua answers this for one mob: the one you
-- have targeted, as a table of everybody in the group, updated on a ticker. It
-- is the right readout for the pull you are in and it is the wrong one for the
-- question you ask by pointing at something across the room, which is not "how
-- fast is everyone gaining" but "if I look away from what I am holding and
-- swing at that instead, whose is it".
--
-- So this is one line, on every hover of a creature, wherever the pointer found
-- it: out in the world, on a nameplate, on the target frame. It is registered
-- against UI/Tip.lua's unit kind rather than written into the part that opens
-- that box, which is the whole point of the registry. World/World.lua knows how
-- to put a tooltip on a mob and knows nothing about threat; this file knows
-- about threat and nothing about hovering. Feeds/Worth.lua is the same shape
-- one kind over, and for the same reason: the loot feed used to be the only
-- place in the game the addon would tell you what a drop was worth.
--
-- **The two clients answer two different questions and the line says which.**
-- TBC has a threat API and the answer is a percentage of whoever is holding the
-- mob. Classic Era has nothing at all: no call in that client computes threat,
-- which is why every Era threat meter parses the combat log. What is left there
-- is who the mob is actually swinging at, which cannot warn you before it turns
-- and can only tell you after. Both are true sentences and neither is dressed
-- up as the other.

-- What the mob is doing, on a client that will not say who is winning.

-- somewhere a bar put green would be the addon disagreeing with itself.
--
-- The idle colour is compared by identity rather than asked for, because
-- Threat.State answers a percentage of nil for two different reasons: you hold
-- the mob and nobody is near you, and the mob has never heard of you. Those are

	-- that could not tell them apart would leave the wrong one on screen for as
	-- long as you looked at the mob.
	--
	-- On Era it is who the mob is swinging at, by GUID, which is exactly what
	-- that client's half of the line says. What neither half catches is a
	-- challenger changing while their share rounds to the same whole number:
	-- the name moves and the digit does not. A stamp catches what it names.
