--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The spell book
--
-- Every spell you know, one row each, with its ranks folded behind one
-- button.
--
-- **That is the whole argument.** The client's own book lists every rank of
-- every spell as its own entry, twelve to a page, so a warrior at sixty pages
-- through Rend six times and Battle Shout seven to find Sunder Armor. Here a
-- spell is one row: the square, the name, and the rank the square is holding
-- on the right. Where you know more than one rank there is a fold-out beside
-- it, and picking a rank there is what the square then casts and what a drag
-- off it puts on a bar. The pick is written down per character, so the rank
-- you set the square to is the rank it opens on tomorrow.
--
-- **It replaces the client's window rather than sitting beside it.**
-- Blizzard.lua puts the client's frame in the attic and takes the P key,
-- behind the one switch on the page where every other Blizzard frame this
-- addon replaces is switched.
--
-- **Every square is a secure button, and everything below that says `secure`
-- or `InCombatLockdown` is there for that one sentence.** A click on a spell
-- casts it, casting is protected, and the only way an addon gets a protected
-- act out of a click is a button built on the secure template. The cost is
-- the one the character sheet already pays: a window with protected frames in
-- it cannot be shown, hidden, sized or repainted by ordinary Lua in a fight.
-- So the key is bound to a secure button whose snippet shows and hides the
-- window, the close cross is one, and everything that writes a square, the
-- rank picked or the book changing, waits for the fight to end and says so.
-- Blizzard's own book does all of that in a fight because Blizzard's code is
-- allowed to.
--
-- **Nothing scrolls.** A tab is laid out in columns and the window is sized
-- to the tallest tab, the way the talent window is sized to the tallest tree.
-- A scroll view would be the canvas the squares hang off moving under the
-- wheel, and moving a frame with protected children is refused in combat;
-- a window whose wheel works out of a fight and is refused in one is a
-- window that feels broken. Grouping the ranks is what makes the count small
-- enough for this: no tab on any class is more than a screen of rows.
--
-- Nothing here is on a ticker. The window paints when it opens and when the
-- client says the book changed, and a window nobody has open is not painted
-- at all.
--
-- **The book is read on the way up, not at login.** Reading it is four client
-- calls per entry over every rank of every spell you know, which on a warrior
-- at sixty is about eight hundred, and it ran at login and again on every
-- SPELLS_CHANGED whether or not anybody had ever opened this. SPELLS_CHANGED
-- marks the book stale now and the first paint after that is what pays for it.
-- A session that never presses P reads the book never.
--
-- The frames are a different question and they stay at login, because the key
-- has to work in a fight. The snippet below is handed the window as a frame
-- reference, a snippet may only touch what it has been given, and neither the
-- window nor the reference can be made in combat. A book built on first press
-- would be a key that does nothing the first time it is pressed in a pull.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The rows go in columns of this many, and the window is as wide as that
-- many columns of the row width below. Two is the client's own count and it
-- is the right one: a row is a square, a name and a rank, and three of those
-- across is names cut short.
local COLUMNS = 2

-- One row of the grid: a square, a name, the rank on the right and the
-- fold-out past it. Wide enough that the longest name on any class, which is
-- the shaman's and the priest's, sits beside its rank without touching.
local ROW_WIDTH = 236

-- The air between two columns, and under the tab strip before the grid.
local BETWEEN = 20

-- One row's pitch: the square, and the air to the next square.

-- past the end of the list, which a client can produce by forgetting a rank,
