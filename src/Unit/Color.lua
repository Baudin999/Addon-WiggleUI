--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The unit palette
--
-- Every colour two or more parts of the addon put on a unit. Not the same
-- palette as ns.UI.Color, which dresses windows and controls: this one is the
-- look of the game world and it answers questions the interface never asks,
-- like what a mob thinks of you.
--
-- It exists because it was written twice. UnitFrames/EnemyBars.lua declared
-- five colours for threat and UnitFrames/Skin.lua declared four for reaction,
-- and four of the nine were the same three literals typed out again. That is
-- fine until somebody warms the green, at which point the mob's bar and your
-- target frame stop agreeing about what friendly looks like and nothing in the
-- build can tell.
--
-- Two layers, and the split is the point. HUE is the set of colours the addon
-- draws with, named for what they are. Everything under it maps a question the
-- game asks onto one of them, named for what it means. A green that appears in
-- two answers is the same table in both, because it is the same green, and one
-- edit moves both.
--
-- Handing back a shared table is not a leak, it is the contract. See the note
-- in Unit/Unit.lua: the tickers guard their widget writes on colour identity,
-- so the same state has to answer the same table every time. Nothing in this
-- file builds a colour at call time and nothing may start.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Contrast
--
-- Which colours may carry text, and which colour that text is.
--
-- This arrived from a screenshot: the player frame drew a white name on the
-- warrior tan, and the two did not hold apart. They were never going to. Tan is
-- #C79C6E, white on it is 2.4:1, and the whole palette was the same shape.
-- White on the threat amber is 1.6:1, on the threat green 2.4:1, on the orange
-- 2.3:1. Only the red and the slate were over four. Every bar this addon draws
-- was carrying a name it was fighting.
--
-- Blizzard's numbers are not wrong, they are for the other problem. A class
-- colour exists to put a player's name IN that colour against a black chat
-- window, where bright is exactly right. A bar fill is the inverse: the colour
-- is the background and the text is on top of it. Six of the nine classes are
-- too light to be a background for anything, and one of them is literally
-- white.
--
-- So the palette carries a rule rather than a pile of hand-picked pairs. Every
-- colour this addon fills a bar with is taken under a luminance ceiling, and
-- the ceiling is the value at which Color.paper clears TEXT_RATIO on it. One
-- text colour, guaranteed on every fill, at every state of the bar: the spent
-- end is the fill through Color.Dim, which is darker still, so a fill that
-- clears also clears there.
--
-- The shaping runs once at load and writes into the tables in place, so a
-- colour keeps the identity Unit/Unit.lua's tickers guard on. Scaling in linear
-- space leaves hue and saturation exactly where they were and only takes
-- brightness off, which is why the warrior still reads as tan and the threat
-- green still reads as green.
--
-- The tokens run the other way. A level tag, a stack count and the name of
-- whoever else has this mob are short coloured strings ON a fill, so they need
-- a floor rather than a ceiling, and a hue that cannot reach it is blended
-- toward white until it does. TOKEN_RATIO is three rather than four and a half
-- and that is a judgement, not a rounding: these are two digits and a percent
-- sign in a HUD, not a paragraph, and holding a five colour scale apart is half
-- of what they are for.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The sRGB transfer function, inverted. WCAG's definition, and the reason the
-- shaping below is done on these numbers rather than on the stored ones: a
-- colour halved in sRGB is not half as bright, and a scale that pretends it is
-- turns a hue as it dims it.

-- Two colours per class, answering two different questions.

--   fill  the bar. The same colour under the luminance ceiling, so the name on
--         top of it can be read. A copy, and shaped by the pass below rather
--         than typed, because arithmetic done once by hand rots the first time
--         the ceiling moves.

-- this table does not know falls back to RAID_CLASS_COLORS and is shaped the
