-- Threat
--
-- What the client's threat API says, asked once and shared. Two parts of the
-- addon want it and they want two different questions answered.
--
--   the enemy bars    who is closest to taking this mob off me, per mob, five
--                     times a second
--   the threat meter  how fast is everyone gaining on the mob I am looking at,
--                     and when does the next one overtake
--
-- The meter's model lives in Meter/Threat.lua, because rate smoothing and a
-- pull ETA are that readout's own arithmetic and nothing else wants them. What
-- is here is the part both were doing separately: probing the API, reading one
-- pair, and walking the group to find the worst.
--
-- Vanilla has no threat API at all. Nothing in that client computes threat,
-- which is why every Classic threat meter parses the combat log instead.
-- Threat.Ready answers once and every caller has its own honest fallback:
-- the bars colour by who each mob is swinging at, and the meter's pane says so
-- and stays empty. Nothing here guesses.
