--   is this GUID one of ours       the combat log names everyone in range,

--                                  pack next door
--   whose pet is this              the log attributes a hunter's damage to
--                                  the pet, and a meter that files that
--                                  separately is a meter that reads a hunter
--                                  as half a hunter

-- the whole fight. Pre-pull is when totems get dropped.
