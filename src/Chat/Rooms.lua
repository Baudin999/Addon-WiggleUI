-- Rooms
--
-- What the chat window is a window onto. A room is one conversation: your
-- party, your guild, the family, one person whispering you. It has a name, a
-- log of its own, a count of what arrived while you were reading something
-- else, and one answer to the question the whole part turns on, which is where
-- a line you type in it goes.
--
-- **This is the reimagining.** The window this replaced had three tabs and a
-- button beside the field that cycled six channels, and the two had nothing to
-- do with each other: you could be reading Whispers and typing into guild, and
-- nothing on the screen would have told you. A room is the two of them made one
-- thing. What you are reading is what you are typing into. Selecting the party
-- room is the same act as choosing to talk to your party, and there is nothing
-- else to press.
--
-- That is also the answer to a sliding spill of messages. A message does not
-- arrive in "the chat"; it arrives in a room, the room says so in the rail with
-- a count against its name, and a room you are not in cannot push anything you
-- are reading off the top of the screen.
--
-- **A room is a view, not a box.** One line lands in every room it belongs to:
-- a whisper from your wife is in Whispers with her name on it, in Family, and
-- in Conversation. Nothing is filed away somewhere you have to remember to go
-- and look, and no room has to be a compromise between two audiences.
--
-- This file knows nothing about frames. It knows which rooms exist right now,
-- where a line goes, and what is unread. Chat/Window.lua draws it.

Rooms.ALL = "all"
Rooms.SYSTEM = "system"
-- What this addon says, on its own. It arrives the way every system line does,
-- through the hook on Blizzard's frame, and it used to be filed in System with
-- the loot and the experience. That is the wrong room for it: a line from the
-- addon is an answer to something you just did, and it was landing under
-- forty lines of a dungeon's drops.
Rooms.KIT = "kit"

-- How many people you can be in the middle of a conversation with before the

-- are not standing there any more. Guild and the numbered channels are a room
-- full of strangers, which is the volume this window exists to get away from.
