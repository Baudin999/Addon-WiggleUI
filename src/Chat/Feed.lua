--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What people said
--
-- Every line of conversation the client hands out, turned into one string with
-- a colour, and handed to whoever is drawing. This file knows nothing about
-- windows, rooms or fonts. It knows which events carry a person talking, what
-- one line of that reads like, and who said it. Chat/Rooms.lua decides where
-- that goes and Chat/Window.lua draws it.
--
-- **Two mechanisms, one job each, and they are not the same job.**
--
-- The capture is an ordinary frame with the CHAT_MSG_ events registered on it.
-- That is what feeds this window, and it has to be a registration of our own
-- rather than a hook on Blizzard's frames, because which messages a Blizzard
-- chat frame receives is a per character setting the player owns: a guild tab
-- turned off in the client's own chat settings is a guild message our window
-- would never see if we were listening through it.
--
-- The claim is ChatFrame_AddMessageEventFilter, which is FrameXML's own
-- extension point and the supported way to stop a message reaching every
-- Blizzard chat frame at once. It exists so the conversation is not drawn
-- twice, once here and once behind, which is exactly the doubled, unreadable
-- screen this part was asked to replace.
--
-- Nothing is unregistered. Blizzard's window keeps everything we do not claim,
-- which is loot, experience, faction, system text, the combat log and every
-- other addon's output, including this one's, and for as long as that window is
-- up it is where you read them. Whether it is up is a setting of its own:
-- Chat/Blizzard.lua hides it and forwards what would have been drawn there to
-- Feed.System below, which is the only way this part ever draws a line it did
-- not capture itself.
--
-- Turning the claim off leaves both windows drawing, which is a real thing to
-- want for a session or two while you decide whether this one is better.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Which rooms a line belongs to is Chat/Rooms.lua's question, not this file's.
-- What this file contributes is the two facts a router needs and only the
-- capture knows: which channel the line came off, and whose line it is.

-- How many lines are held for a window that does not exist yet. The events
-- start at load and the window is built at PLAYER_LOGIN, and between those two
-- moments the client replays whatever the server sent while you were loading.
local PENDING = 100

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What each event is
--
-- tag      what is written in front of the name, in square brackets. One or
--          two letters, because it is read a thousand times an evening and
--          "Party" is six characters of the width that a message could use.
-- color    the key into the client's own ChatTypeInfo, so a player who has
--          recoloured guild chat in the client's settings gets that colour
--          here too. Falling back to the theme where the client has no table.
-- room     which of the fixed rooms this kind belongs to. Say carries yells
--          and emotes, because all three are the people standing near you.
-- whisper  whether it belongs in a conversation with one person as well
-- emote    the message is already a whole sentence with the name in it, so it
--          is drawn without a name and without a colon
-- target   the person the line is about is the recipient rather than the
--          sender, which is what an outgoing whisper is
-- answer   somebody talking to you, so Enter opens the line on this room when
--          it is the newest. See "Who spoke last" in Chat/Rooms.lua.
-- mine     a line you sent, whoever it names, so Shift-Enter comes back here

-- arrives at a chat frame's AddMessage as a finished, coloured string, and
-- there is no supported way to ask where it came from.
--
-- That is why it was left in Blizzard's window for as long as Blizzard's window
-- was on screen, and it is why hiding that window is what brings this function
-- into use. Chat/Blizzard.lua hooks the default frame and hands everything that
-- reaches it here.
--
-- One kind of line is told apart from the rest, and it is this addon's own. It
-- goes to the WiggleUI room rather than to System, because a line the addon
-- said is an answer to something you just did and System is forty lines of
-- loot deep by the time you look for it.
--
-- There is no doubling, and the reason is exact rather than lucky. Hiding the

-- out of its frames before they are drawn, and what is left arriving at
-- AddMessage is precisely what this addon did not capture.

-- be on screen.
--
-- A filter installed while nothing is drawing does not move the conversation,
-- it deletes it: the line comes out of Blizzard's frames and lands in a window
-- that is closed, or in no window at all when the build failed, and the only
-- symptom is a chat log that has gone quiet. That is not a corner case: it is
-- what the close box on this window used to do. One press took the
-- conversation off the screen, the closed state was saved, and Feed.Apply runs
-- again at every login, so every say, party, guild, raid and whisper line
-- stayed deleted until the player found /wui chat. The close box is gone for
-- that reason, and the claim below is still tied to something being drawn.
--
-- The claim is also asked for at ADDON_LOADED, which is before the window
-- exists at all. Holding it back until something is attached is what keeps the
-- client's login replay in Blizzard's window instead of in the hundred line
-- pending buffer, where everything past the hundredth was dropped.
--
-- Hiding Blizzard's window forces the claim, which is the second clause below.
