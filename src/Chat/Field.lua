-- The line you type in, which is the client's own
--
-- This window does not build a field. It borrows the client's, strips the art
-- off it, and anchors it into the footer. Everything a player sees is ours and
-- the frame underneath is Blizzard's, which is the whole point.
--
-- **Why, in one paragraph.** `/logout` ends in Logout(), and the client refuses
-- Logout() from any call stack an addon has been in. A field of our own puts a
-- function of ours in that stack: the client dispatches the key press into our
-- OnEnterPressed, our handler calls the client's parser, and the protected call
-- at the end of it is dropped. Blizzard's field has its OnEnterPressed set in
-- XML, so the press goes from the keyboard into Blizzard code with nothing of
-- ours between, and the command runs. There is no way to fake that from a field
-- we made, which is why the version before this ran protected commands off a
-- secure button and asked the player to press enter twice.
--
-- Prat is where this arrangement is taken from and it has shipped for fifteen
-- years without a /logout bug, because it never had one to fix: the only two
-- edit boxes in it are for copying chat and for search, and the line you send
-- from is always ChatFrame1EditBox. It hides the three border textures, fades
-- the focus glow, sets a font, and anchors the frame wherever it likes.
--
-- **The one rule.** Nothing here calls SetScript on the client's field. Every
-- script it has is Blizzard's and has to stay Blizzard's, or the press that
-- reaches OnEnterPressed is running our replacement and we are back where we
-- started. HookScript chains under what is already there and is safe, and it is
-- the only way this file touches a handler.
--
-- **What we are allowed to write.** The text and the attributes. Both are read
-- back out of C rather than out of a Lua table, so writing them from here does
-- not taint what the client later reads, and Prat's own history module writes
-- the text from an arrow key hook for exactly this reason. Nothing in this file
-- writes a field on the frame or a global of FrameXML's.
--
-- **Who opens it.** The client, off its own OPENCHAT and OPENCHATSLASH keys.
-- This window used to take both keys onto buttons of its own and open the field
-- from a script; that is gone, because a key the client owns end to end is one
-- less thing between the press and the command. ChatWindow.Focus still opens
-- the field from a click on a name, and that path is ours, which is fine: it is
-- for whispering somebody, not for logging out.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Opening
--
-- The client's own OPENCHAT does three things in this order: it picks a field,
-- it activates it, and then it writes the text the key asked for. Enter asks
-- for an empty line and the slash key asks for "/". That last write is the
-- problem this section exists to solve: anything we put in the field while it
-- was activating is gone by the time the player sees it.
--
-- So the room's slash is written twice and the flag below is what makes that
-- safe. The focus arriving sets it and fills the line. If the client then
-- blanks what we wrote, the blanking is a change, the change raises
-- OnTextChanged, and the hook fills the line again and drops the flag. If the
-- client blanks nothing, the flag comes down when the focus goes.
--
-- Nothing else can get through it. A write the player made carries the client's
-- own userInput argument and is skipped on that alone; a write of ours is
-- skipped on `filling`; a write that leaves anything at all in the line is
-- skipped because the line is not empty, which is how the slash key keeps its
-- "/" and how a line you came back to keeps what you had typed.
--
-- **And a write that emptied the line on its way to a channel of its own is
-- skipped too, which is the whisper this flag used to eat.** Whisper on the
-- unit menu is ChatFrameUtil.SendTell, and what that does is put `/w Aria ` in
-- the field a frame after the field took the focus. The client's parser reads
-- it, sets the channel to a whisper addressed to her, and then writes the rest
-- of the line back, which is the empty string. That empty string looks exactly
-- like the blanking above: a write nobody typed, into a line with nothing left
-- in it, while the flag is up. So the room's slash went in over it and the
-- whisper became whatever the room was, which from Say is a sentence about
-- your evening said out loud to a city.
--
-- The two are told apart by the channel rather than by the text, because the
-- channel is the thing that differs: a blanking leaves it where our own fill
-- put it, and this leaves it somewhere else. Somewhere else means somebody
-- meant it, and the line is left alone. Moved below runs a moment later off
-- the same write and walks the window into that person's room.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Where the last fill left the channel, which is what "somewhere else" is
