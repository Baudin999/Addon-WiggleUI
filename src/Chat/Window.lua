--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The chat window
--
-- A column of rooms down the left, the room you picked filling the rest, and
-- one line to type in. Everything in it comes out of UI/: the chrome is
-- UI.Window, the column is UI.List, each log is UI.Log, the bar beside it is
-- UI.ScrollBar and the colours and the pixel metrics are the theme's. There is
-- no Blizzard template anywhere in it and no art asset behind it.
--
-- **Why a column of rooms and not a row of tabs.**
--
-- The window this replaced had three tabs. Three is what fits across the top of
-- a chat window, and that number is what decided the design rather than
-- anything about a conversation: everything anyone said went in one column,
-- because there was nowhere else to put it. A rail has room for thirteen, so a
-- room can be one conversation instead of one compromise. Your party is a room.
-- Your guild is a room. Each family member whispering you is a room. What was
-- one river with a search problem is a list with a count against each name.
--
-- The other half of it is that a tab strip only ever answered where you were
-- reading. This rail answers where you are talking, because they are the same
-- thing now: the room you have selected is the channel the line goes to, and
-- Chat/Compose.lua puts that room's own slash in the field when you start
-- typing. There is no channel button beside the field any more, no second piece
-- of state to disagree with the first, and nothing to press twice.
--
-- **What marks a room.** A count of what arrived while you were reading
-- somewhere else, in the accent colour in the corner of its icon, and the icon
-- brighter than a room with nothing in it. Selecting a room clears its own
-- count. That is the whole of the alert design: no flashing, no toast, no sound
-- unless somebody in one of your groups spoke.
--
-- **Why the rail is icons and the window has no title bar.**
--
-- Both are the same sum. Thirteen room names are a hundred and four pixels of
-- every line anybody said, spent labelling rooms you know by sight; a title bar
-- is twenty four more naming a window you have had open all evening; the
-- heading and the note under it were twenty eight under that. That is a third
-- of a small chat window given over to captions.
--
-- Nothing they said was thrown away. A room's name, what the enter key would do
-- in it and how much is waiting are in its hover. Which room you are in and
-- what enter will do are written into the empty line you type on, which is
-- where you are looking when it matters and is the same argument the slash in
-- the field has always been.
--
-- **There is no close box, and no saved hidden state.** A cross sat at the foot
-- of the rail once. It took the conversation off the screen in one press, wrote
-- that down, and left nothing behind saying where it had gone, so the window
-- stayed gone across reloads and the way back was a slash word you had to know.
-- The way to be rid of the window is the setting that turns the part off, which
-- is where every other part of this addon is switched off and which the panel
-- lists. /wk chat still hides it for the session, and a reload brings it back.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

local FRAME_NAME = "WarriorKitChat"

-- The client's two chat keys are the client's. This window took both of them
-- onto buttons of its own for a while, so that enter opened the line down here
-- rather than the invisible one behind it, and that arrangement is gone.
--
-- What it cost was `/logout`. A key bound to a button of ours opens the line
-- from a script of ours, and a line opened from a script is a line whose enter
-- key runs down a stack an addon has been in, which is a stack the client will
-- not finish a protected command on. Now the keys go straight into FrameXML,
-- FrameXML opens the field this window borrowed, and the press that finishes a
-- command is Blizzard's from the keyboard down. See Chat/Field.lua.

local window, rail, entry, voice

-- Where a log goes and how big it is, written in the layout section below and
-- named here because the log pool above needs it: a room's log is made the
-- first time somebody speaks in that room, which is after the layout ran.
local Frame, Place

-- One log per room that has ever held a line, and the ones whose rooms have
-- gone. A frame cannot be destroyed on this client, so a whisper conversation
-- that fell off the end of the rail leaves its log here to be emptied and given
-- to the next one rather than kept forever.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What the last attempt did
--
-- One sentence, written at every step of standing the window up, and written to
-- the saved variables as well as to this local.
--
-- The saved copy is the point. The failure this is for is the one nobody can
-- see: no window on the screen, the client swallowing the error because
-- scriptErrors ships off, and Blizzard's own window left up by the coupling
-- that is meant to be a safety net. Three silences, and every one of them looks
-- from the outside like a part that did nothing. A sentence in a local is no
-- help there, because the thing that would print it is the window that did not
-- build; a sentence in the saved file is still there after the reload, and the
-- panel, `/wk status` and anyone reading WTF all get the same answer out of it.
--
-- It is a saved variable that is not a setting, which is the one of those in the
-- addon. It earns that by being the only channel out of a failure that has no
-- other channel.

-- during a failure is the only chat window there is. The same shape as the log
-- refusing a ScrollingMessageFrame and saying so: a part that cannot draw has to
-- be able to say why.
