-- What was said, kept across a logout
--
-- Every other thing this part holds is a fact about the session: which rooms
-- are on the rail, what is unread in each, what is in a log. A reload threw
-- the lot away, and for the guild and the numbered channels that is right,
-- because nothing in either is addressed to you. For two rooms it is not. A
-- whisper is a conversation with one person and half of it is not one, and the
-- party chat you scrolled back through to find the summon location is gone the
-- moment an addon update makes you reload.
--
-- So those two are written down. This file is the record and nothing else: it
-- knows how to hold a line, when a line is too old to hold, and how many lines
-- are worth somebody's disk. Chat/Rooms.lua decides which lines those are,
-- because which room a line belongs to is its question, and Chat/Window.lua
-- draws what comes back.
--
-- **A day, and then it is gone.** Not a setting, and not a cap on its own. A
-- transcript kept for a week is a file that grows all week and a window that
-- opens on last Tuesday; a transcript kept for an hour is one that has thrown
-- away the summon location by the time you look for it. A day is the session
-- you just played and the one before it, which is the span anybody actually
-- scrolls back over, and it is also the span that makes the record safe to
-- keep at all: what is on this disk in a week's time is nothing.
--
-- **Per character.** A whisper is addressed to a character and the party you
-- were in was this one's, so it goes in WiggleUICharDB beside the experience
-- tally and the damage record rather than in the account file beside the
-- groups.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How long a line is kept, and how many are kept at once.
--
-- The cap is the second half of the same promise and it is the one that holds
-- on a raid night: a day of a busy party is more lines than anybody scrolls
-- through, and a saved variables file is read and written whole at every login
-- and logout. Four hundred lines is about six screens of the window at its
-- shipped size, which is further back than the scroll wheel goes in one sweep.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Where it is kept
--
-- Made on the way in rather than trusted to be there. The defaults hand every
-- character an empty pair at ADDON_LOADED, and a file edited by hand can hold
-- neither; a nil here is a line that raises inside an event handler, which is
-- the one place in this addon a raise is swallowed.

-- What is too old, and what is too much
--
-- Both answers are a count off the front, because the list is in the order the
-- lines arrived: everything before the first line inside the day goes, and so
-- does everything past the cap.
--
-- Compacted in one pass rather than by a table.remove for each. A login that
-- comes back to a day-old file drops the lot in one call, and doing that an
-- entry at a time would shift the array once per line dropped.
