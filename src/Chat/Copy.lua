-- Copying what was said
--
-- The client has no clipboard call. The one way text leaves the game is
-- Ctrl-C over a selection in an edit box that holds the keyboard, and a
-- ScrollingMessageFrame is not one: you can read it and you cannot select a
-- word of it. So this is a second window with one field in it, filled with
-- the room you were reading, selected whole, waiting for the key.
--
-- One window, reused, for the reason UI/Ask.lua gives: this client cannot
-- destroy a frame, so a window per copy is a window leaked per copy. And one
-- room at a time rather than everything, because "what was said" is a room's
-- question. Conversation holds every line anybody said, System holds what the
-- game said, and the WiggleUI room holds what this addon said, so copying
-- the room you are in is copying whichever of those you meant.
--
-- The field is not a place to type. Anything typed over it is put back, the
-- way the console's readout does it, so what the box shows is always the log
-- and never a line somebody's Ctrl-V landed in.
