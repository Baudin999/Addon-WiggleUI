-- The line you type
--
-- Where it goes, and what is already in the field when you start.
--
-- **The field is filled in with the room's own slash.** Select the party room,
-- press the key, and the line reads `/p ` with the cursor after it. That is the
-- one thing this part was asked for and it is worth saying why it is the slash
-- rather than a label beside the field, which is what the window used to have.
--
-- A label is the addon telling you where the line will go. The slash is the
-- line itself, and it is the same slash you have typed ten thousand times. You
-- can see it, you can delete it, you can change the p to a g, and everything
-- you already know about typing in this game still works: `/w Aria` from inside
-- the guild room whispers Aria and leaves the guild room where it was. There is
-- no second state anywhere saying what channel you are in, because the state is
-- the text in the field.
--
-- **A line you typed is read by the client, not by this file.** The field is
-- Blizzard's, so the enter key hands what is in it to FrameXML's own parser,
-- which knows every slash word in the game including the ones that log you out.
-- The prefix above is the whole of what this file contributes to a typed line.
--
-- What is left below is for code. Compose.Send is the path a slash word of ours
-- and the harness take, and it splits the same way the client does: a channel
-- this addon can name goes out with one SendChatMessage, and anything else goes
-- to ChatEdit_SendText. Rebuilding the second half here would mean keeping up
-- with every command in the game.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What you type for a channel, and what the client calls it. Both spellings of
-- everything, because a habit is per person: /p and /party are the same key
-- press to two different people.
--
-- /r is reply and not raid. That is the client's own arrangement and getting it
-- the wrong way round here would send a whisper meant for one person to forty.

-- Sending
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The client's own parser, for everything that is not a channel: /dance, /join,
-- another addon's command. Blizzard's field is where it has to happen, because
-- ChatEdit_SendText reads the box it is given.
--
-- Only ever reached from code. A line the player typed never comes through
-- here: it is already sitting in the client's field and the client's own enter
-- key sends it, which is the whole arrangement Chat/Field.lua sets up. What is
-- left for this is the harness and a slash word of ours that wants to say
-- something, and neither of those is a key press.
--
-- So a protected command handed to this is still refused, and that is correct
-- rather than a gap. ChatEdit_SendText called from Lua is a stack an addon has
-- been in whoever calls it, and no arrangement of ours can make code that runs
-- with no player behind it log the player out.

-- The commands the client will not take from us
--
-- There is nothing here any more, and the emptiness is the fix.
--
-- `/logout` ends in Logout(), and the client refuses Logout() from any call
-- stack an addon has been in. For a long time this file answered that with a
-- secure button: the line went onto the enter key as macrotext, the client ran
-- it as its own work on the next press, and the player was told to press enter
-- twice. Around it stood a list of thirty five slash words that might end in a
-- protected call, an alias table, a debug log, and four functions arming and
-- disarming a key binding.
--
-- All of it was compensation for one line in Chat/Window.lua that made an edit
-- box. That line is gone. The field this window types into is the client's own,
-- its OnEnterPressed is Blizzard's and set in XML, and the press that finishes
-- a command goes from the keyboard into FrameXML with nothing of ours between.
-- So `/logout` logs you out, on the first press, and no list of words is needed
-- to know which commands are special, because none of them are.
--
-- Chat/Field.lua is where the arrangement lives and why it is safe.
