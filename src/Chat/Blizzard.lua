--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Blizzard's chat window, off the screen
--
-- The switch is `hide Blizzard's chat window`, and it sits with the other six
-- in Core/BlizzHide.lua, because a player who can see two chat windows
-- should find the line that turns one off on the page where every other line
-- like it lives. What is here is the part that would not fit on that line.
--
-- Everything the game says to you that is not somebody talking arrives at that
-- window and nowhere else. Loot, experience, reputation, your own repair bill,
-- every addon's output, this addon's own. Hiding the frame without doing
-- anything else would delete all of it.
--
-- So hiding is three things that only work together.
--
--   The frames go off the screen. Every chat frame, its tab, its buttons and
--   the furniture round them, into Core/Attic.lua, which re-parents each one
--   into a frame that is hidden and can never be shown. That is what `/logout`
--   defeated in the version before this: the frames were held by putting their
--   own Hide where their Show was, `FCF_` puts a docked frame back with
--   SetShown, and SetShown is resolved in C and never reads the Lua field. A
--   hidden parent has no such hole.
--
--   Everything that would have been drawn in the default frame is forwarded to
--   the System room in our window. That is one hook on AddMessage, and it is
--   allowed to be a plain forward with no filtering because of the third piece.
--
--   The claim is forced on. Chat/Feed.lua takes every conversation event out of
--   Blizzard's frames before FrameXML draws it, so what is left arriving at
--   AddMessage is exactly what this addon did not capture. That is the
--   difference between forwarding and doubling, and it is the reason the README
--   used to say this could not be done: with the claim off there is no way to
--   know which lines at AddMessage came from an event we already drew.
--
-- **Hiding follows the window.** Our window closed and Blizzard's hidden is a
-- game with no chat at all, so closing ours puts theirs back on the next call,
-- the same way the claim does and for the same reason. That coupling is not a
-- nicety: the first version of the claim did not have it and one press of a
-- close box deleted every line of conversation from the screen.
--
-- Nothing here is protected and nothing here is secure, so all of it works in
-- combat. The client's own edit box is deliberately left alone: it is what
-- ChatEdit_SendText needs to run a slash command, and it comes up over whatever
-- is hidden behind it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What goes away besides the numbered frames. Every name is probed before it is
-- touched, because these differ between the two clients this addon ships for
-- and a missing one has to cost that frame rather than the feature.

-- Frames this file has taken down, so the same set goes back.
--
-- Handing a frame back shows it, which is right for every other caller: a frame
-- this addon replaces was on the screen before it did. It is wrong here, because
-- eight of the ten chat frames have never been on screen in most installs and
-- putting the window back would turn on eight tabs nobody has ever opened. So
-- only a frame that was showing when it was first seen is taken at all.

-- built since, which is every temporary window a whisper opens, and it cannot
-- see one the client put back by a route the hide did not cover. So nothing is
-- remembered: every pass walks every name and reads what is on the screen.
