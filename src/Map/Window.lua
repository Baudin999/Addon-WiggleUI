--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The world map
--
-- A column of every zone in the game down the left, the zone you picked drawn
-- beside it, Questie's markers on top of it, and a line along the bottom saying
-- who that zone is for.
--
-- **The zone list is the point.** The client's world map navigates by clicking
-- a continent, reading the shapes, and clicking the piece of coastline you
-- think is the place you meant. That is a fine way to learn a world and a bad
-- way to answer "show me Desolace", which is the question anybody who has
-- played for a week is actually asking. A column of names answers it in one
-- click and never needs the continent map at all.
--
-- The column is a fold, one group per continent, one row per zone, alphabetical
-- inside each. Alphabetical rather than by level, and that is a real choice: a
-- list sorted by level is a better list to plan an evening with and a worse one
-- to find a name in, and the level is on the screen anyway, in the footer,
-- which is the half you cannot get any other way.
--
-- **The edges of the picture step to the next zone, the way the client's map
-- does.** A zone's art does not stop at the border: it runs a little way into
-- whatever is next to it, and the client keeps a table saying which strip of
-- the picture belongs to which neighbour. That table is what makes a click on
-- the top of Elwynn open Westfall on Blizzard's map, and C_Map will answer it
-- for any point of any map, so it is one call here rather than a list of
-- borders written down. The column is how you cross the world; the edges are
-- how you walk next door, which is the move a map is actually for.
--
-- **The picture is the same widget the quest log's map is.** UI/Chart.lua draws
-- a zone out of the client's own tiles and puts points on it, and the wheel
-- zooms it at the cursor. Nothing about it is new here. What is new is what
-- goes on top.
--
-- **The markers are Questie's own, read off Questie's own frames.** Map/Pins.lua
-- carries the argument in full: Questie has already decided which quests you
-- can take and drawn a frame per marker, and this reads the frames rather than
-- asking the database the same question again and getting a different answer.
-- So the map shows exactly what Questie shows, in the same art, with the same
-- colours, and a Questie setting turned off turns them off here too.
--
-- **The right button steps out to the continent.** The column reaches a zone in
-- one click and the picture reaches the zone next door on a click at its edge,
-- and between them there was no way at all to look at Kalimdor. So every
-- continent has a row of its own at the top of its group, the picture draws it
-- like any other map, and the right button on any zone goes to the one it is
-- on. Left goes in, right goes out, which is the client's own gesture.
--
-- **Your group is on the picture, as the client's party pin.** Map/Mates.lua
-- carries that in full. The short of it is that the client will say where a
-- party member is standing on any map you hand it, so the marks cost one call
-- each and nothing is worked out here.
--
-- **The footer says who the zone is for.** It is the one fact the client has
-- never put on its own map and the one everybody wants from a world map before
-- level sixty: not where Desolace is, but whether Desolace is where you should
-- be. Map/Zones.lua carries the table and the reason it has to be a table.
--
-- **Everything is built once.** The rail holds sixty rows and the chart holds
-- a pool of tiles and markers, and this client cannot destroy a frame, so a
-- window that rebuilt either on a click would leak a zone's worth of frames per
-- click all evening. It is the same argument the quest log's two scrolling
-- columns make one file across.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How big the map itself is drawn.
--
-- The client's own zone art is 1002 by 668, which is the size Blizzard's world
-- map draws a zone at, and it is the size this draws one at: the ask was a map
-- the same size as the one it replaces, and the honest way to hold that is to
-- draw the art at its own size rather than to measure somebody else's frame at
-- a scale this window is not on.
--
-- The zone column is extra width rather than width taken off the picture. A
-- selector that made the map smaller would be paying for navigation with the
-- thing being navigated.
