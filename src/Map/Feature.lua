-- Where a finished quest's question mark went
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- One line per quest the client says is ready to hand in.
--
-- Written because "the question mark is missing" is not a question the map can
-- answer from the picture. The picture is the markers that survived, and every
-- interesting case is a marker that did not: Questie never drew one, Questie
-- drew one and hid it, or it drew one on a zone other than the one you are
-- standing in, which is what a quest you pick up in one place and hand in
-- another looks like from here.
--
-- Asked against the zone you are standing in rather than the zone on the board,
-- because you can read the board and you are typing this about the zone you are
-- in. Map/Pins.lua does the looking; this walks the log and prints.
--
-- A word after it names one quest instead, matched on any part of its title and
-- printed whether the client calls it finished or not. That is the half the
-- ready-to-hand-in sweep cannot reach: a quest the log draws as complete and
-- the client does not flag is a quest the sweep walks straight past, and "it is
-- not in the list" is the one answer that tells you nothing.
--
-- Client.Open first, for the reason Quests/Log.lua gives. A collapsed header
-- hides its quests from the client's own row count, so a sweep that does not
-- open them reports on the zones you happen to have unfolded and calls that
-- your quest log.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- One kind of place switched, and the map painted again if it is open.
-- Map/Places.lua carries the reason the state is Questie's and not this
-- addon's.
--
-- Painted now rather than a moment later, and that is a known short fall.
-- Questie spawns a kind of NPC over a few ticks, thirty two a hundredth of a
-- second, so a repaint on the click has the mailboxes, which Questie draws in
-- one go, and not yet the flight masters. They are on the map the next time
-- it is painted, which is when it opens and on every quest log event, and in
-- play that is the next few seconds. A repaint booked half a second out would
-- be the whole chart on a tick path, which is what the hot path scan in
-- scripts/hot.lua refuses, and it is right to.

--
-- Built out of the list at the panel's build, which is the first time anybody
-- opens the options window, and Questie's lists are saved variables it fills
-- on its first ever login, so on every login after that the rows are there. On
