-- Everyone else in your group, on the map
--
-- The one thing on a world map that no database can answer and no addon can
-- work out: where the four people you are playing with are standing right now.
-- Blizzard's own map has drawn it since the first client, this one had a column
-- of every zone in the game and no way to see that the healer is still at the
-- flight master, and a party map that cannot say where the party is is a map
-- you go back to the client's own for.
--
-- **The client places them, not this file.** It answers where a member is
-- standing in the continent's own yards, and it turns those yards into a
-- fraction of whatever map it is handed; both calls answer for your party and
-- your raid. That is the whole mechanism, and it is two calls rather than the
-- one the arrow uses because this client answers that one for you alone. The
-- alternative is what the libraries do: read the yards and carry a table of
-- every zone's rectangle to divide them by. That table is the thing that goes
-- stale, and there is no reason to keep one when the client will do the
-- arithmetic. UI/Chart.lua carries the calls and the order the yards go in.
--
-- It is also what makes the continent picture work for nothing. Ask about a
-- zone and you get the people standing in that zone; ask about Kalimdor and you
-- get everybody who is anywhere on Kalimdor, each at their place on it. Neither
-- case is written here.
--
-- **A member the client will not place is a mark with nowhere to be, not a
-- mark that does not exist.** There are four ordinary ways to be unplaceable:
-- in an instance, on another continent, on a map that is not the one being
-- drawn, and offline. All four come back the same way, as no answer.
--
-- The point is still handed over, with no place on it, and the board hides it
-- until there is one. That is what makes the picture live in both directions.
-- The board takes every point carrying a unit again ten times a second, so a
-- member who walks out of the zone loses their mark within the tick, and one
-- who walks in gets theirs the same way. Handing over only the members who
-- happened to be here at the moment the map was painted made the first of those
-- work and the second wait for the next repaint, which on a window you have
-- open and are watching is the whole of what you opened it for.
--
-- Mates.Describe is what tells you the difference between "nobody is here" and
-- "this client would not say", because those look identical on the map and are
-- not the same fault.
--
-- **Blizzard's party pin, and the class colour on the hover.** The client's
-- own map draws everybody in your group as Interface\WorldMap\WorldMapPartyIcon
-- at sixteen pixels and untinted, in UnitPositionFrameTemplates.lua and
-- GroupMembersDataProvider.lua. That dot has meant "one of mine" since the
-- first client, and the class-coloured square this file drew instead read as a
-- quest camp in a colour nobody had picked. Which of them it is sits on the
-- hover: the name, in the colour the party frames, the meter and the chat use
-- for the same person.

		--
		-- The line for somebody with nowhere to be is never read, because the
