--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The client's bags, and the key that opens them
--
-- The same shape as Map/Blizzard.lua and Quests/Blizzard.lua, so this header
-- only writes down where this one differs.
--
-- **Nothing goes in the attic.** The client's bags are not a frame you hide,
-- they are frames the client only ever shows through nine named calls. Take the
-- nine and the frames are never built onto the screen in the first place, which
-- is cheaper than caging thirteen containers and cannot leave one of them
-- half-placed on the way past. There is no equivalent for a map or a mailbox,
-- which is why those two are caged and this one is not.
--
-- **All nine, not just the toggle.** B is `ToggleBackpack`, the bag buttons on
-- the bar are `ToggleBag`, the binding for all of them is `ToggleAllBags`, and
-- then there are the six the client calls on your behalf: `OpenAllBags` when
-- you talk to a merchant or open the bank, `CloseAllBags` when you walk away
-- from either, and the backpack and single-bag pairs under those. Take the
-- toggle alone and the first merchant you speak to puts five of Blizzard's bags
-- on the screen beside this window.
--
-- **A replacement, not a hook.** Everything else in this addon that touches a
-- Blizzard frame uses hooksecurefunc, which runs after the client's own code
-- and cannot stop it, and stopping it is the entire job here. What was on each
-- name is kept so the switch can hand all nine back exactly.
--
-- **This is the one part that will argue with another bag addon.** Baganator
-- and Bagnon take the same names, and whichever of us loads last is the one
-- holding them. That is not a bug to work around, it is what replacing the bags
-- means, and the panel says so rather than the two of us fighting over B every
-- reload.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What the window does when the client asks for the bags.
--
-- Named functions at file scope rather than closures made at the swap, because
-- the swap runs on the once-a-second pass and a fresh closure a second is
-- garbage the collector walks. It is also what makes "are we already holding
-- it" a comparison rather than a guess.
--
-- Every one of them ignores its arguments. `ToggleBag` and `OpenBag` are handed
-- a bag number and there is one window for all five, so which bag the client
-- meant is not a question this window has an answer to.
--
-- **And none of them answers anything, because none of Blizzard's nine does.**
-- One of the nine is read. `CloseAllWindows` opens with
-- `local bagsVisible = CloseAllBags()` and hands that back as "something was
-- closed"; `ToggleGameMenu` runs a chain of elseifs and the branch under
-- `securecall("CloseAllWindows")` is the one that puts the system menu on the
-- screen. So a `CloseAllBags` that says yes on a press with no bags open is
-- escape that closes windows, cancels a cursor, and never once opens the menu,
-- with nothing on the screen to say why. The bag window's own Show, Hide and
-- Toggle answer whether they did anything, which every other caller wants and
-- this one must not see.
