-- The squares
--
-- One button per bag slot, drawn where the pile it belongs to puts it. The
-- pool never shrinks and a square is reassigned to whatever slot lands on it
-- this pass, which is what lets a hundred and fifty of them be laid out again
-- for the price of a hundred and fifty anchors.
--
-- **What a square looks like is UI/Slot.lua's.** The sunken ground, the
-- hairline in the item's own grade, the crisp icon and the count in the corner
-- are the same in the merchant window, and one of them differing by a pixel
-- when the two are open beside each other is why that file exists. What is left
-- here is everything that is a fact about a bag slot and about nothing else.
--
-- **The button is the client's own template and that is the whole design.**
-- `ContainerFrameItemButtonTemplate` is what every bag button in the game is
-- built on, Blizzard's and every addon's, and inheriting it means the click, the
-- drag, the stack split, the shift-link and the merchant sale are the client's
-- code rather than ours. None of that is reimplementable: a right click on a
-- bag slot means eat, equip, open, sell or attach depending on which window is
-- in front of you, and the rules for which are inside the client. That is the
-- one thing the merchant window's rows do not do and do not want: buying is one
-- call with one meaning.
--
-- It also keeps that click secure, which is the only way a right click on a
-- scroll reads it: `C_Container.UseContainerItem` is protected, and the
-- template's own OnClick is the only path to it this addon has. So the OnClick
-- is never set here. Mail/Bags.lua wants the right button while the mail
-- window is open, and it takes it through Bags.Dress, which registers the
-- square for the left button alone and hangs an OnMouseUp on it; both are
-- widget settings and taint nothing. A square is dressed once when built, so
-- one born with the mail window open arrives already knowing.
--
-- **A slot is its own id and its bag is its parent's.** That is where the
-- client keeps it and the only thing the template's own handlers have to go on,
-- so every square is parented to a holder frame carrying the bag number. The
-- holders are all the size of the canvas, so a square is anchored inside its
-- own parent and the layout never has to know which holder it landed in.
--
-- **Three piles are drawn in two lanes.** Weapons and armour are the only
-- things you carry that bind, so they are the only piles where "already mine"
-- and "still worth something to somebody else" is a division you can make.
-- The quest pile divides the same way on a different fact: what a quest in
-- your log still wants, and what nothing in it wants. Yours on the left,
-- not on the right, half a square of air between them, and each lane wraps
-- inside its own half of the width. Which piles split, and on what, is
-- Core/Piles.lua's; which lane a square is in is Bags/Bags.lua's, written on
-- the entry as `yours`; how wide a lane is and where the second one starts
-- are here, because they are drawing.
--
-- **Two piles are cut into sub-piles.** Trade goods and miscellany arrive as
-- a heading row with nothing under it and then a row per subclass, each with
-- its own smaller caption: Trade Goods, then Cloth over the cloth, then
-- Metal & Stone over the ore. Which piles cut and where is Core/Piles.lua's
-- too; what a sub-caption looks like is UI/Slot.lua's; that a heading with
-- nothing under it takes its own line and no air after it is here.
--
-- Every other pile is one lane of the full width and spends the same half square
-- as air at its right edge. That is deliberate and it is what Grid.Width adds:
-- a window as wide as the widest pile in it is a window that changes width when
-- you pick up a sword.
--
-- **Piles flow across the window before they go down it.** Seventeen piles cut
-- into sub-piles came to twenty-odd captions, most of them over one square, and
-- one square under a heading on a line of its own is a heading's worth of
-- height for a square's worth of bag: the window was a column you scrolled
-- with your bag beside it, which is the thing this window exists not to be.
-- So a pile is a block, as wide as its squares or as wide as its name, and the
-- blocks are laid left to right along a line with half a square of air between
-- them, wrapping to the next line only when the next block will not fit. A
-- block that would fit if it were narrower is narrowed and its squares wrap
-- inside it, down to half of what it wanted, so a big pile beside a small one
-- shares the line rather than starting a new one under a square of nothing.
-- A split pile takes a whole line, because its two lanes are the width. A cut
-- pile's heading is a block with no squares, and its sub-piles flow after it
-- on the same line with their captions dropped to the same height, so "Trade
-- Goods" reads once at the left and the cloth, the leather and the meat sit in
-- one row beside it.
--
-- **At a merchant the layout holds still.** Selling a grey takes it out of its
-- pile, and a pile that closes the gap moves every square after it, so a grid
-- you were reading for the next thing to be rid of is a grid you read again
-- from the top after every sale. The first paint at a vendor lays the piles
-- out and holds them; every paint after it keeps each square where it is and
-- asks the scan what is lying on its slot now. A slot that emptied stays as
-- an empty square, which is the placeholder that keeps everything else in
-- place. Walking away lets go. See Hold below for what breaks it early.
--
-- **The art is ours and the behaviour is theirs.** The template arrives dressed
-- for a window that looks nothing like this one, so UI.Undress sweeps every
-- region it brought and UI.Dress draws the square again in the addon's palette.
--
-- The cooldown frame is the one exception and it is exactly the shape of the
-- rule: it is stripped from nothing because nothing here draws a replacement,
-- and the client's own call is what fills it in.
--
-- The hover is the addon's own box for the same reason. A window drawn in this
-- palette with the client's tiled parchment opening over it is two designs on
-- one screen, which is the defect the addon's own box exists to stop.
--
-- **Nothing here hands the right button to the camera.** UI.PassCamera is on
-- every other hoverable frame in the addon and it is deliberately off these, for
-- the reason Character/Paperdoll.lua spells out at its own squares: a square
-- whose right click is an action cannot also pass the right button through. The
-- right click on a bag slot is the whole of eat, equip, open, sell, attach and
-- put a stone on your axe, and with the button passed through every one of them
-- went to the camera instead. The square drew, hovered and said what was in it,
-- and a right click turned the view.
--
-- The price is the one named in UI/Tip.lua and it is paid here on purpose: a
-- right drag begun on a square does not turn the camera. There are two pixels
-- between squares and a frame around the window, so there is somewhere on it to
-- start a drag; there is nowhere else to put a right click.

-- A distance in this window's units, snapped to a whole number of pixels.
--
-- The window is drawn at a zoom, and a zoom of one and three tenths puts one
-- unit on one and three tenths of a pixel. A square whose top lands on a
-- fraction of a pixel has a one pixel hairline along that edge asking to be
-- drawn between two pixels, and the client draws it on one of them or on
-- neither depending on which fraction it got. What that looked like was every
-- bottom edge missing from one row of squares and every top edge missing from
-- the row below it, with the left and right edges of the same squares correct:
-- the columns happened to fall on a fraction the client draws and the rows on
-- one it does not.
--
-- So nothing in this grid is placed or sized in units. Every origin and the
-- side of every square goes through here, which puts every hairline on a pixel
-- of its own however the zoom divides. Rounded at layout rather than baked into
-- the constants because the answer is a fact about the frame: the same
-- thirty-one units is a different number of pixels at every zoom, and only the
-- canvas can say which. Asked of the canvas rather than of a square because the
