--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What you are carrying, in piles
--
-- The scan, and no frame anywhere in the file. Grid.lua draws what this answers
-- and Window.lua decides when to ask.
--
-- **One question here goes through a frame and it is not this file's.** Whether
-- an item has already bound to you is written nowhere an API will hand over, and
-- the only way to it is the client's own tooltip pointed at the slot. UI/Scan.lua
-- owns that frame and is the one file allowed to, so what this file does is ask
-- it a question and get a yes or a no back. See Lane below.
--
-- **The piles themselves are Core/Piles.lua's.** Which class an item is filed
-- under, what that class is called in your language, and what order the piles
-- are drawn in were all in this file until the merchant window wanted the same
-- answers about a vendor's stock. What is left here is the half that is
-- genuinely about your bags: which five of them to walk, what a slot is worth,
-- and the one fold that turns forty empty squares into one.
--
-- **The bank is not here.** Five bags, the backpack and the four on the belt,
-- which is what you are carrying. A bank window is a second window reading a
-- second set of bag numbers, and it can be written the day somebody wants it
-- without changing a line of this file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The backpack and the four on the belt. The bank's bags are numbered past
-- these and the keyring below them, and neither is what this window is about.
local FIRST_BAG, LAST_BAG = 0, 4

-- The two piles this part names by hand. Both are Core's, aliased here because
-- Grid.lua and Merchant.lua ask a question about a bag square and a bag square
-- is this file's subject.
Bags.EMPTY, Bags.JUNK = ns.Piles.EMPTY, ns.Piles.JUNK

-- The client's own word for an item that has already bound to you.
--
-- The global rather than the English, because this is compared against text the
-- client wrote and on a German client it wrote "Seelengebunden". The fallback
-- is there so a build that has renamed the global still reads right on an
-- English client rather than filing every sword as unbound.
local SOULBOUND = _G.ITEM_SOULBOUND or "Soulbound"

-- One table, refilled on every scan rather than rebuilt.
--
-- A bag update arrives five times for one loot and the window answers each of
-- them, so a scan that allocated a table per slot would be a hundred and fifty
-- objects for a stack of cloth. The entries are a pool keyed by how far into
-- the walk they are, which is stable because the walk is: bag zero slot one is
-- entry one whatever is in it.
local state = { groups = {}, entries = {}, shown = 0, free = 0, slots = 0 }

-- Where each bag's slots begin in the walk, so a square can find the entry for
-- its own slot by arithmetic rather than by searching a hundred and fifty.
-- Written on every sweep, because a bag swapped for a bigger one moves every
-- bag after it.
local starts = {}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Whether a vendor will take what is on this square.
--
-- The client's own sell price and no rule of ours. Nought is the answer for a
-- quest item, a soulbound token and everything else the game will not buy back,
-- and nil is an item this client has not cached yet, which reads as no for the
-- reason the junk pile refuses to grade one: a guess here is a square drawn as
-- sellable that a merchant then refuses.
function Bags.Sellable(entry)
	return entry.link ~= nil and (entry.price or 0) > 0
end

-- The empty pile, folded into the one square that says how many there are.
--
-- Forty free slots drew forty identical grey squares, which is forty squares
-- carrying one number between them and a screen of scrolling to reach the pile
-- under them. What is kept is the first slot of the pile, which after the sort
-- is the lowest bag and slot you have free, and it carries the count of the
-- whole pile.
--
-- The square that survives is a real slot and not a placard, which is the
-- reason the first one is kept rather than a made up entry: it has a bag and a
-- slot, so the client's own handlers still take a drag onto it and the item
-- lands somewhere free. The count on it is the pile's size rather than a stack
-- size, and Grid.lua draws it in the middle of the square for that reason.
--
-- The free count in the footer is not read from here. Sweep counts it off the
-- slots themselves, so folding the pile cannot change the number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The scan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Which lane a square in a split pile goes in, which is whether the thing on
-- it is yours: bound to you, or wanted by a quest you are on.
--
-- Core/Piles.lua says which fact a pile divides on and this is where each is
-- read, because each is read off something only a bag scan can reach.
--
-- **Binding is read off the client's own tooltip and there is no other way to
-- it.** The link carries no history: a sword you have been swinging for three
-- months and the same sword on a vendor's shelf are character for character
-- the same string, and GetItemInfo answers "binds when equipped" about both.
-- Only the slot knows, which is why this takes a bag and a slot and why
-- UI/Scan.lua's `bag` kind exists. See Head in UI/Tip.lua, which is the other
-- caller that had to know.
--
-- Asked every scan and cached nowhere. The obvious cache is the pooled entry
-- itself, keyed on the link and the slot, and it is wrong in both directions.
-- An item the client has not graded yet answers a tooltip that says so, and a
-- cached "not bound" from the first scan after a login never gets asked again
-- however many times GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED repaints the window. A bind on use
-- item bound in place is the other half: same link, same slot, different answer.
-- Scan.Has allocates nothing, so what a cache would buy here is a handful of C
-- calls, and what it costs is a lane that is quietly wrong for the session.
--
-- Nil from the probe is a client that will not take the question, and it reads
-- as unbound: one lane holding everything is a pile that looks like every other
-- pile in the window, and the alternative is a lane of soulbound greens that are
-- nothing of the sort.
--
-- **A quest item is read off Questie's item rows and the quest log.**
-- Core/QuestItems.lua answers two things: where in the log the quest that
-- wants it sits, which is the item's rank and what the pile sorts on, and
-- whether anything wants it at all, which is the lane. Its "cannot say" is the
-- left lane, for the reason that file gives, so a session with no Questie in
-- it draws the quest pile in one lane like every other pile and never offers
-- anything up.
--
-- Asked only of a pile that is drawn in two lanes, which is twenty squares in
-- a full bag rather than a hundred and fifty. Everything else is filed the
-- same whatever its binding, so either read would be paid for nothing.
