--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The bag window
--
-- One window, one scroll view, five marks along the top, the four bags you
-- wear along the foot and the two numbers under them. Bags.lua answers what is
-- in there, Grid.lua draws it and Belt.lua draws the bags themselves; this file
-- owns when to ask and how big the answer is allowed to be.
--
-- **The free count is in the footer and it is half the reason the window
-- exists.** Every bag interface in the game makes you count the empty squares
-- yourself, and the number you actually want before a dungeon is one number.
-- It sits beside your gold because those are the two facts about your bags that
-- are not about any one item in them.
--
-- **The window redraws on the event and not on a clock.** A bag update arrives
-- in bursts, five of them for one loot, and each one is answered in full: a scan
-- of a hundred and fifty slots and a hundred and fifty anchors. That is what the
-- client's own bags do on the same event and it is cheaper than it sounds,
-- because the pool is already built and the scan allocates nothing per slot. A
-- clock would buy a fraction of that back and cost the thing the window is for,
-- which is looking at it and seeing what you just picked up.
--
-- Nothing is drawn at all while the window is shut. Every refresh below returns
-- early on a hidden window, so a character who never opens their bags pays for
-- this part exactly once, at the login that registers the events.
--
-- **The width is the grid's and the height is the piles'.** How many columns is
-- a setting, because how wide a bag window should be is a fact about your screen
-- and about how much of it you are willing to give a bag window. The height is
-- not a setting and it is not a constant either: it is whatever the piles came
-- to this scan, so a full bag is one page and you look at it rather than
-- scrolling it. That is the whole of what a bag window is for. Every other
-- window in this addon is a fixed rectangle because what goes in it is a feed
-- with no end; a bag has a hundred and fifty slots and that is the top of it.
--
-- The scroll view stays, and it is the answer to the one case the height cannot
-- reach: Window:Resize clamps to what the screen holds, so a bag that comes to
-- more than that gets a clamped window and a bar, rather than a window with its
-- footer under the taskbar.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The shortest the body is allowed to get, so an empty bag is a window rather
-- than a strip of title bar with a number under it. A heading and two rows of
-- squares, in UI/Slot.lua's numbers rather than the grid's, because the grid
-- does not own them either.
local FLOOR = UI.SLOT_HEADER + UI.SLOT * 2 + UI.SLOT_GAP

-- The title bar's buttons are squares, one mark each, at the height the close
-- cross already is. Five of them wearing words were a title bar that was more
-- word than title, and a word that changes as you press it, record to stop, is
-- a button that changes width under the pointer. A mark is one size forever
-- and the sentence a hover says is where the word went.

-- Comfort/Clutter.lua is the only one that decides what may go; a clear button
-- that did the work here would be a second set of rules about what is finished
-- with, and the first time the two disagreed the bag window would be the one
-- destroying an item the other would have kept. The filter is the same
-- argument the other way round: Comfort/Wanted.lua owns the switch, and the

-- what opened the window half a bag below wherever it had been dragged, every

-- An item let go of over the window and not over a square.
--
-- A square is the client's own bag button and a drop on one is the client's

-- air between squares, a heading, the title bar, is this frame, and a frame
-- with no answer for the drop leaves the item on the cursor, so the player
-- who pulled a helmet off the character sheet and let go of it over their
-- bags is still holding it. Dropped anywhere on the window it goes in the
-- first bag with room, which is what dropping it on the bag buttons along the
-- bar would have done, and is the only thing "into my bag" can mean.
--
-- Two scripts rather than one, for the reason UI/Widgets.lua gives its drop
-- square: an item picked up with a click arrives as a mouse up and one dragged
-- off a slot arrives as a received drag, and a window that listened for one
-- would take a helmet and refuse a sword. Nothing is drawn here: the client
-- fires the bag update the move causes and the window redraws on that, the

-- What makes it redraw
--
-- BAG_UPDATE is a slot changing. ITEM_LOCK_CHANGED is a stack picked up or put
-- down, which is what makes a square go dark while the cursor holds it.
-- PLAYER_MONEY is the number on the right. GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED is the one
-- that is not obvious: an item the client had not cached is graded nil, so it
-- sits in its class pile rather than in Junk until the answer arrives, and this
-- is the arrival.
--
-- One redraw a frame, whatever the client says in it. Every one of these fires
-- more than once for one thing happening: BAG_UPDATE comes once per bag, so
-- looting a stack that spills across two bags is two, and a vendor sale that
-- moves the money is a third with PLAYER_MONEY behind it. A refresh reads every
-- slot you own, regrades every item and lays the piles out again, so paying for
-- it four times in a frame is four full passes to draw one picture.
--
-- Booked rather than run, the way Core's binding pass is booked: the events set
-- a flag, an OnUpdate that only exists while one is booked runs the refresh on
-- the next frame, and it hands its own handler back. A frame in which nothing
-- moved costs nothing at all.
