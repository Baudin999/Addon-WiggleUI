-- Arranging the row, on the page
--
-- The row as it will look, at the size it will be drawn, with the squares that
-- are off it underneath. What you do to it is what anybody does to a row of
-- icons and has done since the first action bar: drag a spell out of your
-- spellbook onto a line, drag a square from one line to the other, drag one off
-- to stop counting it.
--
-- This replaced twenty-three rows of controls, five per entry: a tick box that
-- said whether the square was on the row, two buttons that walked it one place
-- along its line, a third that sent it to the other line, and a cross. Every
-- one of them described a picture instead of being one, and the picture was on
-- the other side of the screen. Nobody arranging a row of icons wants to read
-- the row out as a list and then edit the list.
--
-- Three things follow from drawing the row rather than listing it.
--
-- The sizes come off Row.lua rather than out of this file. A big square is a
-- press you are waiting for right now and a small one is a press you are
-- waiting for this fight, and that difference is carried by nothing but how big
-- they are. A page that picked its own ratio would be teaching the wrong
-- reading of the thing it exists to arrange.
--
-- The line wraps here and does not wrap in the game. The row on screen is as
-- wide as it needs to be; the page is under four hundred pixels. Eleven squares
-- on the top line have to be shown somewhere, so the wrap is the page saying it
-- cannot draw the line at the width the game will.
--
-- And what is off the row is drawn too. A square you dragged off that appeared
-- nowhere would be one you could not put back: a trinket cannot be dragged out
-- of your spellbook, and neither can a spell you have not trained.

-- The column the words "off the row" sit in, to the left of the squares that
-- are. Wide enough for the caption at the small face and nothing more, because

local CAPTION = 76

-- The two pools, built once at login at the ceiling, because a frame cannot be
-- destroyed on these clients and a pool sized to the list would leak a square
-- every time you dragged one.
--
-- One pool for both lines rather than one each. A square is a place on the row
-- and not an entry: which line it stands on and how far along it is are written
-- every time the page is laid out, so the top line taking six squares and the
-- docked line taking four is one pool of ten and not two of twenty-three.
--
-- Two past the ceiling, for the empty square at the end of each line that a
-- drop lands on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What the cursor is holding

-- A refusal is said once per reason rather than once per ask. The square puts
-- the same question to this on the way in as it does on a drop, so a cursor
-- carrying something the row cannot count passes through here every time the
-- mouse crosses a square. Keyed by the sentence, the way Hover/Panel.lua keys
-- its own, so a second thing going wrong still gets said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The two ends of a drag
--
-- A drag out of a square goes one of two ways and the page picks between them
-- once, at the start, on whether the cursor took what was in it.
--
-- A spell rides the cursor, which is how every icon in the game moves and is
-- why one dragged off the row can be dropped on an action bar. The drop is then
-- an ordinary drop and the square it lands on reads it off the cursor.
--
-- A trinket cannot. Picking up an equipped item unequips it, which is not what
-- the drag meant, so nothing goes on the cursor and the square is remembered
-- instead. Where the button comes up is what the client is asked at the end,
-- and a drag that ended over nothing leaves the square off the row, which is
-- what dragging it off means.
--
-- The two cannot both fire for one drag, because `pending` is set only when the
-- cursor came up empty. That is what makes the order the client fires them in
-- something this file does not have to know.
