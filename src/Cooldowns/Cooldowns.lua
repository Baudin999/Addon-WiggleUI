--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The cooldowns, in two layers
--
-- What this answers is one question the rest of the addon does not: how long
-- until the thing you win the fight with is back. The bars already draw a swipe
-- on every square, and a swipe on a square that is off the bottom of the screen
-- or on a page you are not standing in says nothing at all. Death Wish is three
-- minutes, Recklessness is thirty, Shield Wall is thirty, and a warrior counts
-- all three in their head because nothing on the screen counts them.
--
-- Two layers, because there are two of those questions and they are not asked
-- at the same rate.
--
--   rotation   the six to twelve seconds the fight is actually made of.
--              Stormstrike, Mortal Strike, Thunder Clap, Shield Slam. Looked at
--              constantly, pressed the moment it comes back, and read out of
--              the corner of the eye, so these are the big squares and they are
--              the top line.
--
--   long       the minutes. Recklessness, Shamanistic Rage, Shield Wall, a
--              trinket. Looked at twice a fight, so they are smaller and docked
--              under the line above rather than competing with it for the same
--              glance.
--
-- A row that drew both at one size was the version this replaced, and the
-- complaint against it is that it made a thirty minute cooldown and a ten second
-- one look like the same kind of fact.
--
-- Three sources, and the split is the whole of this file.
--
-- Your spec's two lists are facts and live in Class\<yours>.lua, which is the
-- rule every other part follows. Nothing here names a spell, and a spec that
-- registers neither field gets a row of trinkets or no row at all.
--
-- The trinkets are not a class fact and are the same two slots for everybody,
-- so they are here. Which trinket is worth a square is decided by the client:
-- an item with a use effect answers ns.ItemSpell with the name of it and a
-- passive one answers nothing, so the row carries the ones you press and skips
-- the ones you merely wear. That test is better than a cooldown reading,
-- because a passive trinket with a proc on it has a cooldown too and a square
-- saying "ready" about a proc is a square telling you to press something you
-- cannot press.
--
-- What is deliberately not here is a judgement about which cooldowns matter.
-- The class files list what is long and worth counting, IsSpellKnown drops
-- whatever this character has not learned or has not talented, and one switch
-- per entry drops whatever you personally do not want to look at. Three filters
-- and none of them is this file having an opinion about your spec.
--
-- Nothing in here draws. Row.lua is the row and Feature.lua is the settings,
-- which is the seam every part in this addon has.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Below this a cooldown is the global rather than the ability's own. The same
-- 1.5 Buttons\Slot.lua and Buffs\Racials.lua carry, and it is tested against
-- the whole duration rather than what is left of it: a three minute cooldown
-- with a second to run is still a cooldown, and a ready spell caught under the
-- global you just triggered is not.
local GCD = 1.5

-- How many entries one spec may put on each line of the row. Both are ceilings
-- rather than targets: the row is built once at login at the ceiling, because a
-- frame cannot be destroyed on these clients, and a spec that overran one would
-- lose squares off the end with nothing on screen saying so. Both are one or two
-- past the longest list any class file writes today.
local MAX_ROTATION = 7
local MAX_CLASS = 8

-- And how many you may add yourself, on top of whatever your class brought.
-- Six, and it is room reserved on screen rather than a target: the squares are
-- built at the ceiling at login whether you use them or not, so this number is
-- what the row costs to have the feature at all.
local MAX_MINE = 6

local NONE = {}

-- Which line a square is drawn on. Two strings rather than two booleans or a

-- The two trinkets
--
-- One entry each, built at load and filled in whenever the worn gear moves.
-- `slot` is what makes an entry a trinket: everything that reads state branches
-- on it once, because a worn item answers a different call from a spell and
-- nothing else about the two differs.
--
-- The keys are the words you type at them, so `/wui cooldowns trinket1 off`
-- silences the top one. Numbered rather than named after whatever is in the
-- slot today, because the switch is per character and outlives the trinket.

-- unknown and the unnameable taken out. Rebuilt on an event, never on a tick.
local order = {}

-- And what is off the row on purpose: the entries this character could draw and
-- has switched off. Kept beside `order` and built in the same walk, because the
-- page draws both and a square you took off the row that is nowhere on the page
-- is a square you cannot put back.
--
-- The unlearned and the unnameable are on neither list. There is nothing to
-- show and nothing to drag: a trinket slot with a passive item in it and a
-- talent nobody has spent a point on are facts about the character rather than
-- squares somebody moved.
local shelf = {}

-- How many times the list has been rebuilt, so the row can tell that what it
-- laid out is stale without comparing the list to itself. A count rather than a
-- length, because a rebuild can leave the list exactly as long as it was and
-- hold different entries: one spell trained and another switched off in the same
-- moment is two squares changing places and no number moving.
local epoch = 0

-- Aura name to entry, for the scan. A burst cooldown that is running is the
-- other half of the question this row answers, and the client will not say so:
-- the spell's cooldown starts the moment you press it and says nothing about

-- Resolving one entry
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The first of an entry's ids this client both names and this character knows,

--
-- Two questions in one walk and they are not the same question. A client that
-- cannot name an id is a client that never shipped the spell, which is most of
-- what separates Era from Burning Crusade in the class files. A character that
-- does not know a spell it can name is a talent unspent or a trainer unvisited,
-- and that one changes during a session, which is why SPELLS_CHANGED rebuilds.

-- three things it cannot know: the spell you press on this character and on no
-- other, the one whoever wrote the file left out, and the one you want counted
-- for a fight next week and not after. So the row takes entries of your own,
-- the way the debuff row on an enemy bar does, and they are per character for

--
-- An id and nothing else is saved. Which line one of yours draws on is held
