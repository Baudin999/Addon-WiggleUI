--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The row
--
-- Two lines. The rotation cooldowns are big squares along the top and the long
-- ones are smaller squares docked under them, with your trinkets on the end of
-- the docked line. Cooldowns.lua decides what is on both and this file decides
-- when they are on the screen and what they look like.
--
-- One frame and one walk rather than two of each, because the two lines move
-- together, are dragged together, hide together and are read in one glance.
-- Two frames would have been two anchors to save, two settings, two preview
-- states and two entries in the placing list, for a block a player thinks of as
-- one thing.
--
-- Four decisions, and each one is the row rather than a detail of it.
--
-- It is up for the whole fight. That is the opposite of the buff nag, which is
-- only there when something is wrong, and the two questions are opposites: what
-- is missing is a thing you fix and then want gone, and how long until
-- Recklessness is a thing you ask again ten seconds later. A row that appeared
-- when a cooldown became ready would be telling you at exactly the moment you
-- no longer need telling.
--
-- Out of combat it is up only while something is still recovering, which is the
-- pull-or-wait question and the only reason to look at it between fights.
-- Everything ready is the resting state, and a row that sat there saying so
-- would be furniture inside a week. `/wui cooldowns idle on` keeps it up anyway
-- for anyone who disagrees.
--
-- Ready is worth a colour here, which is why this is the one row in the addon
-- built on ns.UI.Ability.SHOUT rather than on QUIET. The action bars use the
-- quiet palette because twenty-four green squares say nothing; five squares
-- with two of them green is the answer to what have I got, read in one glance
-- without counting.
--
-- Built out of UI\Ability.lua, which already draws the square, the swipe, the
-- timer and the border that carries a status, and already guards every write it
-- makes. This file adds no drawing of its own.

local FRAME_NAME = "WiggleUICooldowns"

-- Two sizes, one per line.
--
-- 27 is the number Buffs\Nag.lua and Meter\Window.lua carry: the client stores
-- a spell icon at 64 texels, UI\Draw.lua crops the five texel border off each
-- edge, and the 54 that are left resample exactly onto 54 pixels or onto 27 and
-- nothing in between. That is the docked line.
--
-- 54 is the other exact size and it is the top line. Doubling rather than
-- picking a number in between is not a preference: 40 would draw 54 texels over
-- 38 pixels, which is most of the way between the two copies the client keeps
-- and is as blended as an icon gets. The two sizes this row may use are the two
-- the art has, and the same arithmetic is written out at length in the header
-- of UnitFrames\EnemyBars.lua.
--
-- The size difference is the whole reading. A big square is a press you are
-- waiting for right now and a small one is a press you are waiting for this
-- fight, and nobody has to be told which is which.

-- What Place last laid out, so a tick that changes nothing does no work.
--
-- Three values and the middle one is the one that is easy to leave out. `mode`
-- is why the row is on the screen, `seen` is which build of the list was laid
-- out, and `count` is how many squares that put on the screen.
--
-- Comparing the list's length against `count` instead is the bug this carries a
-- name for: a quiet row draws nothing, so `count` is zero while the list is
-- five, the two never agree, and the row lays itself out again ten times a
-- second for as long as it is hidden. Comparing lengths at all is the same bug
-- one step quieter, because a rebuild that swaps one entry for another leaves
-- the length where it was and the row would go on drawing the old one.

--
-- A line with nothing on it takes no room at all, which is what makes one shape

-- class nobody has written a file for draws its trinkets on the docked line
-- with nothing above them.
