-- One button that holds all the other addons' buttons.
--
-- Every addon that wants to be reachable puts a round icon on the edge of the
-- minimap, and with eight of them installed the map is a ring of icons with a
-- map in the middle. None of them is pressed more than twice an evening. They
-- belong behind one square rather than around the thing you are trying to
-- read.
--
-- Three rules shape the file.
--
--   A button is borrowed, not taken. Its parent, its points and its own
--   SetPoint are all put back on release, and nothing about the button itself
--   is changed: not its scripts, not its textures, not its size. Press it in
--   the tray and it does exactly what it did on the ring.
--
--   Blizzard's buttons are not addon buttons. The mail icon, the tracking
--   icon and the calendar are things you read at a glance without pressing,
--   and Minimap/Shape.lua has already put them on the corners. The deny list
--   below is the line between the two.
--
--   No ticker. Addons load late and put their button up whenever they please,
--   so the scan runs on the two edges that mean "something may have appeared",
--   which are an addon finishing loading and the tray being opened, and never
--   on a clock.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Which buttons are addon buttons
--
-- This test shipped as "named, parented to the minimap, not Blizzard's and not
-- ours", and it collected 555 of them on the first real client it met. The
-- minimap is not only where addons hang their button. It is also where every
-- addon that draws a pin on the map hangs the pin, and Questie alone parents
-- several hundred quest icons to it. The corral took the lot, and because a
-- taken button has its SetPoint replaced with a no-op, Questie then could not
-- move its own pins.
--
-- So the test is four things now, and the last is the one that matters.
--
--   A Button. A pin is often a Frame and a minimap button is almost never one.
--   This alone is most of the fix and none of the safety.
--
--   Sized like a button. LibDBIcon draws at 31 and everything that rolls its
--   own lands within a few pixels of it. A pin is drawn at 12 to 16.
--
--   Not one of a family. This is the rule that would have caught the 555 on
--   its own, and it is the only one here that is about shape rather than about
--   numbers. Pins are pooled, and a pool is named by counter: QuestieFrame1,
--   QuestieFrame2, QuestieFrame3. A minimap button has one name and no
--   siblings. So candidates are grouped by their name with the trailing digits
--   taken off, and any group with more than two in it is a pool and is left
--   alone entirely.
--
--   And a ceiling, which is not a filter but a refusal. Past CEILING the scan
--   stops and says how many it walked away from, because a corral that has
--   quietly eaten something is exactly the failure this comment is about.

-- Borrowing a button
--
-- A minimap button is usually dragged around its ring by its own OnUpdate or
-- OnDragStop, which means it writes its own position back whenever it feels
-- like it. Reparenting it is not enough: it would sit in the tray for a second
-- and then jump back onto the arc.
--
-- So its SetPoint is replaced with a method that does nothing, the same trick
-- and for the same reason as ns.Strip replacing Show with Hide. The real one
-- is kept on the button and handed back on release. This is done to a frame
-- the addon does not own, which is why the release path is written first and
-- tested before anything is held.
