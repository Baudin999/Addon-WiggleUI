-- The minimap, square and as big as you asked for.
--
-- The round minimap is a mask and a ring of art, and neither carries any
-- information. The mask throws away the corners of a map the client has
-- already drawn, and the ring spends about twenty pixels of every edge on
-- rivets. Take both off and the same frame shows more world at the same size,
-- with an edge that lines up with every other edge in this addon.
--
-- Three rules shape the file, and they are the ones Artwork.lua works to as
-- well, because this is the same job on a different frame.
--
--   Everything is reversible in one call. The mask goes back, the art comes
--   back, the size goes back, and every button this file moved goes back to
--   the point it was found on. `off` is a state, not a reload.
--
--   Nothing is named that is not resolved through _G first. This client is TBC
--   art under a backported interface, and a texture the wiki names may not be
--   the one 2.5.6 has. A missing name is a skipped entry.
--
--   The map itself is never touched. Minimap:SetMaskTexture and
--   Minimap:SetSize are the whole of what happens to it. No hooks, no ticker,
--   nothing on the frame that draws the world.

-- The bezel
--

-- and the world runs out to a rectangle with nothing round it, which reads as
-- a hole cut in the screen rather than as a map.
--
-- Buttons/Bars.lua already answered this for the action bars: a few pixels of
-- near black round the squares with a hairline on the outside of it, which is
-- what makes twelve icons read as one object. The map gets the same box, at the
-- same width, in the same two colours, because they are meant to look like two
-- pieces of one interface.
--
-- Four bands rather than one filled rectangle. A rectangle would have to be
-- drawn under the map to avoid covering the world, and where a child frame
-- lands against its parent's own drawing is the client's business rather than
-- something an addon gets to state. Four bands sit entirely outside the map's
-- bounds and cover nothing whatever the client decides.
