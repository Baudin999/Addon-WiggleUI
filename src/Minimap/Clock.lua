-- The clock
--
-- Blizzard's went with the rest of the minimap furniture, and it had to. It
-- draws its numbers on a strip of the old stone tile, so on a square map with
-- the ring stripped it was the last piece of Blizzard art on the screen,
-- hanging under the bottom edge looking like the one bit of the round map that
-- survived. Minimap/Shape.lua takes it off. This puts the reading back.
--
-- A tab, not a box beside the map. It hangs off the middle of the bottom of
-- the bezel and shares its top row of pixels with the bezel's bottom edge, and
-- the seam between the two is painted out, so the hairline runs round the map
-- and the clock together as one silhouette. That join is the whole reason this
-- is a file rather than four lines in Shape.lua.
--
-- What it says is local time. Blizzard's could be told to say either and
-- shipped saying the realm's, which is the time an addon needs and not the
-- time a person does; the realm's is one hover away. The twelve hour toggle is
-- read off the client's own CVar, because a player who set it set it for a
-- clock and this is the clock now.
--
-- The tick looks once a second and writes twice an hour. Everything else it
-- does is one string comparison.
