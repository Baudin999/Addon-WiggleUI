--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The merchant window
--
-- One window, one scroll view, and the two numbers along the bottom. Stock.lua
-- answers what the vendor has and Grid.lua draws it; this file owns when to ask
-- and how big the answer is allowed to be.
--
-- **It is the bag window's shape in the two places that matter and its own
-- everywhere else.** The two are open at the same time and they are the same
-- act: what you have, and what he has. The piles are the same piles under the
-- same headings, the square is the same square, and your purse is in the same
-- corner of the footer. The width and the height are this window's own.
--
-- The bag window grows to fit what it is drawing, and it argues for that: a bag
-- has a hundred and fifty slots and that is the top of it, so you would rather
-- look at it than scroll it. A vendor's rack has no such top. A quartermaster
-- sells sixty things, and this window grew to fit all sixty, hit the clamp at
-- eighty six percent of the screen, and kept its old top edge, so most of the
-- list hung off the bottom of the screen and the rows down there were nowhere a
-- click could reach. That is the shape UI/Window.lua's header already rules on:
-- the window is a fixed rectangle and what does not fit scrolls.
--
-- Ten lines of two cards is twenty things at once, which is every ordinary
-- vendor in the game whole and a quartermaster in three flicks of a wheel. The
-- client's own frame shows ten and pages; this shows twice that and scrolls.
--
-- **Closing the window walks away from the vendor.** The client's own merchant
-- frame is parked off the side of the screen while this one is up, so its cross
-- is nowhere a cursor can reach and the session would otherwise stay open until
-- you ran out of range. Every way out of this window goes through the frame's
-- own OnHide, which is where escape and the close box both land, so there is
-- one place that ends the session rather than one per exit.
--
-- **Two racks, one window, one tab across the top.** What he sells and what you
-- have sold are the two halves of a merchant session, and the second one is the
-- game's only undo for a sale. The client keeps it behind the second tab of its
-- own frame, and that frame is parked off the side of the screen for the whole
-- session, so replacing the merchant window without replacing buyback left an
-- hour-long safety net nothing could reach. Both racks are drawn by one pool of
-- cards out of Grid.lua and the tab says which one is under it.
--
-- **The title is the vendor's name.** It is the one thing about a merchant
-- window worth a title bar: you talk to four of them in a row in a capital and
-- the rack alone does not always say which. A client that will not answer gets
-- the plain word.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How wide the window is: two cards, in Grid.lua's cards.
--
-- Two because that is the client's own merchant frame, and because a card is
-- wide enough to hold a name and a price without cutting either. It was the bag
-- window's column setting for a day, on the argument that two windows open
-- beside each other should be the same width. That argument was answering the
-- wrong question. The bag window's width is how many pictures fit on a line and
-- this one's is how long an item's name is, and tying the second to the first
-- gave the rack a width nothing about a rack had asked for.
--
-- A fixed count rather than a setting of its own. A card has one right width,
-- which is the width of the longest thing a vendor sells; the only choice left
-- is how many of them, and a third column is wider than the game's own window
-- for a list you are already scrolling.
local COLUMNS = 2

end

-- How tall the rack is, and it does not move.
--
-- Ten lines of cards and four pile headings, which is twenty entries on the
-- screen at once and every ordinary vendor's whole stock. Written as the pieces
-- rather than as one number so that a card or a heading changing size moves it,
-- which is what stopped it being a number somebody has to remember to revisit.
--
-- It is a size rather than a count of what this vendor has, so the window is
-- the same shape whatever you walk up to: a window that is a different height
-- at every vendor is a window whose close cross is somewhere new every time.
--
-- It is how tall the rack is and not how tall the window is. The tab strip is
-- added on top of it once the strip has said how tall it came out, so putting
-- the second rack in cost a row of tabs rather than a row of stock.
--
-- A card is a square tall, so the lines below are Grid.lua's rows and
-- UI/Slot.lua's numbers still measure them.

-- BAG_UPDATE are the two halves of what you can afford: the purse for an
-- ordinary price and what you are carrying for a rack priced in tokens.
-- GET_ITEM_INFO_RECEIVED is the one that is not obvious, and it is the same one
-- the bag window listens for: an item the client had not cached is graded nil,
-- so it sits under the wrong heading until the answer arrives.
--
-- Those last three are also what a sale looks like from here. Selling something
-- moves the purse, empties a bag slot and puts a row on the buyback rack, and
-- the client says so twice; there is no event of its own for the second rack.
