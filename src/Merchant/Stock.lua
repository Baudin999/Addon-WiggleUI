-- What the vendor has, in piles
--
-- The scan and no frame anywhere in the file, which is the shape Bags/Bags.lua
-- has and for the same reason: Grid.lua draws what this answers and Window.lua
-- decides when to ask.
--
-- **The piles are the bag window's piles.** Core/Piles.lua files a merchant's
-- stock under the same class headings it files your bags under, in the same
-- order, in the same words. That is worth more here than it looks. Two windows
-- are open at a vendor and both are lists of items; a reagent vendor's rack
-- reading Reagent while the stack of the same reagents in your bags reads
-- Reagent means you can see at a glance which of the two you are looking at
-- something in.
--
-- **A page is not a thing here.** The client draws ten at a time and puts an
-- arrow under them, so buying the fourth thing on the second page of a
-- quartermaster is two clicks of an arrow before the click that matters. The
-- merchant index runs from one to GetMerchantNumItems and this walks all of it,
-- because a scroll bar is what a list longer than a window is for and the addon
-- already has one.
--
-- **Everything is read fresh on every pass.** A vendor with limited stock counts
-- down as you buy, an entry priced in tokens changes what you can afford as you
-- spend them, and MERCHANT_UPDATE is the client saying one of those moved. The
-- rack is thirty rows at most, so there is nothing here worth caching and a
-- cache would be the thing that draws a row you can no longer buy.
