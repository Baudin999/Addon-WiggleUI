-- The rack
--
-- One card per thing the vendor sells, drawn where the pile it belongs to puts
-- it. The pool never shrinks and a card is reassigned to whatever the scan put
-- on it this pass, which is the same trick Bags/Grid.lua plays with its squares
-- and for the same reason: a merchant update arrives in bursts and every one of
-- them is answered by laying the whole rack out again.
--
-- **A card is a square with the name and the price beside it.** This was a bare
-- grid of squares for a day and the day was enough. A vendor's rack is not a
-- bag: a bag is a hundred and fifty pictures of things you already own and
-- recognise, and a rack is a price list. Squares alone drew a run of small
-- pictures with no word anywhere on them, which is the one shape a shop must
-- not have, and the price was a hover away on every single entry. What you are
-- deciding at a vendor is whether a thing is worth what he is asking, and both
-- halves of that have to be on the screen at once.
--
-- **Two columns of them, which is the client's own shape.** Blizzard's merchant
-- frame is two columns of exactly this card, ten to a page, and the reason it
-- reads well at a glance is the reason it is copied here. What is not copied is
-- the paging: the columns run down one scrolling list, so a quartermaster with
-- sixty things is three flicks of a wheel rather than six presses of an arrow,
-- and the piles keep their headings the whole way down.
--
-- **The square is the bag window's square, and it is one file.** UI/Slot.lua
-- draws it for both, because a vendor's rack and your bags are open beside each
-- other and two squares that differ by a pixel of inset or a shade of grey is
-- worse than either. The count in its corner is how many one press buys, which
-- is the same corner a bag square keeps its stack size in and means the same
-- thing from the other side.
--
-- **One pool draws both racks.** The window has two: what the vendor sells and
-- what you sold him. A card is the same card on either, so which rack is being
-- drawn arrives as the thing that answers questions about an entry rather than
-- as a flag. Stock.lua and Buyback.lua both answer InStock, Left, Afford,
-- Batches and Buy, this file calls those five on whichever it was handed, and
-- the tab swaps it. A second pool would be a second copy of the layout below,
-- kept in step by hand.
--
-- **The buttons mean what they mean on Blizzard's rack.** Right buys one of
-- the vendor's own batches. Left picks a batch up onto the cursor, where the
-- client draws it under the pointer and buys it when you drop it on a bag, and
-- a left drag is the same pickup. Shift opens the number picker on anything
-- sold in stacks and does nothing on anything that is not, and any modified
-- press is offered to the client first, which is how shift links the item
-- into an open chat box and control opens the dressing room. All of that is
-- MerchantItemButton_OnClick and _OnModifiedClick on the TBC branch, copied
-- rather than improved, because a player who has bought water from every
-- vendor since 2005 does not read a tooltip to learn which button spends.
-- For a day the left button bought and the right went to the camera, and a
-- right click did nothing at all. The number picker is UI/Amount.lua, which
-- is a window of its own rather than a control on sixty cards.
--
-- **Nothing here is a secure button and nothing needs to be.** A bag square
-- inherits the client's own template because a right click on one means eat,
-- equip, open, sell or attach depending on what is in front of you, and the
-- rules for which are inside the client. Buying is one call with one meaning
-- and picking up is another, so the card is an ordinary button. What it does
-- share with a bag square is the price named in UI/Tip.lua: a card whose right
-- click spends cannot hand the right button to the camera, so a right drag
-- begun on a card does not turn the view. The gaps and the frame around the
-- rack are where a drag starts.
