--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Questie's tracker, switched off by its own hand
--
-- **Its own call and nothing else.** `QuestieTracker:Disable()` is what
-- Questie's own "Enable Tracker" checkbox calls, and `Enable()` is what puts it
-- back; Modules/Options/TrackerTab/QuestieOptionsTracker.lua is four lines long
-- for exactly this. There is no Hide here, no SetParent, and nothing goes into
-- Core/Attic.lua.
--
-- The attic is for Blizzard's frames and the difference is who else is holding
-- them. Nothing re-parents a client frame behind us; Questie re-shows its
-- tracker on a dozen of its own events, so a frame hidden here comes back on
-- the first quest accepted and the answer to that is to hide it again, forever,
-- once per event. Turning the feature off at the source is one call and the
-- events stop happening.
--
-- **This addon writes another addon's saved setting, and that is new.**
-- Everything else it does to a neighbour is a function swap it can hand back
-- inside the session. `Questie.db.profile.trackerEnabled` outlives the session,
-- outlives this addon being uninstalled, and is a box the player may well have
-- ticked themselves. A feature that moved it quietly is a feature that reads as
-- Questie breaking, so it gets a switch with its own name on it and a clause in
-- `/wk status` saying which way the setting is and who put it there.
--
-- **Two ends and a record between them.** Quests/Blizzard.lua's rule is that
-- the switch owns the state and the file's job is that the two ends agree, and
-- there the two ends are our switch and our own cage. Here there is a third
-- party: Questie's setting has an owner who is not us. So `questsTrackerTook`
-- is the record of whether this addon is the one holding the tracker off, and
-- it is a saved variable rather than an upvalue because `Disable()` reloads the
-- interface and an upvalue would not survive the reload it caused.
--
-- The record is what stops the two failures that are not symmetrical. With the
-- switch on and the tracker already off because the player turned it off in
-- Questie, nothing is done and nothing is claimed, so unticking our box later
-- does not switch on a tracker the player never wanted. And with the switch on
-- and the record set, the two ends agree at every login after the first, so
-- `Disable()` runs once rather than once a session.
--
-- **Neither call is made in combat.** Questie's own checkbox greys itself out
-- on InCombatLockdown and the reason is on the other side of the call: Enable
-- rebuilds the tracker's frames. Work refused here is held by ns.Lockdown to
-- the end of the fight, and `/wk status` says so while it is waiting.
--
-- **Both calls reload the interface.** Questie's Disable ends in ReloadUI and
-- its Enable hands ReloadUI to ThreadLib as the callback; its own checkbox says
-- so in the description text. Nothing here can avoid that and nothing should
-- try, so the panel says it in front of the box.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Questie's tracker module, or nil, asked for by the two calls this file makes.
--
-- QuestieTracker is a module on Questie's own loader rather than anything in
-- Public/, so it comes through ns.Questie and not ns.QuestieAPI. Both calls are
-- declared with a colon in Questie's source and are therefore called with one
-- here; ns.Questie checks that the field is a function, which is the same
-- question for either spelling.

-- Questie's settings table, or nil, and it answers three things at once: that
-- Questie is installed, that its database has initialised past the preinit
-- placeholder in Modules/VersionCheck.lua, and that this build still spells the
-- setting this way.
