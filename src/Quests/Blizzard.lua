-- Blizzard's quest log, out of the way
--
-- **This one goes in the attic, and the mail window does not.**
--
-- That difference is the whole file and it is worth stating, because
-- Mail/Blizzard.lua argues at length that its frame must be parked rather than
-- caged, and the next person to read these two files together will wonder which
-- of them is wrong.
--
-- Neither. MailFrame is a live interaction with the server: the client ends the
-- mailbox session when that frame stops being drawn, so hiding it is what closes
-- the mailbox. QuestLogFrame is not. Nothing about your quest log is a session,
-- every quest API works with the frame nowhere near the screen, and the
-- selection cursor those APIs read is global state rather than the frame's.
-- Quests/Client.lua reads and writes it with the frame caged and the client
-- neither notices nor cares.
--
-- So this takes the stronger mechanism. Core/Attic.lua re-parents the frame
-- into a room that is hidden, and a frame whose parent is hidden is not drawn
-- whatever anything calls on it. Parking would leave a window off the side of
-- the screen that a client relayout could put back; the cage cannot be undone
-- except by somebody else's SetParent, and Attic.Sweep is what checks that.
--
-- **The key has to come with it.** Hiding the window and leaving L bound to the
-- client's own toggle is a log you cannot open, which is a worse state than
-- either window on its own. ToggleQuestLog is a plain global on both of these
-- clients, so it is replaced with one that opens this addon's window, and the
-- original is kept so the switch can put it back. That is a global function
-- swap and it is the only one in the addon, which is why it is here rather than
-- anywhere subtler: one file, named after what it does to Blizzard's frame.
--
-- **The switch is `hide Blizzard's quest log`.** Off, both windows work and the
-- key opens theirs, which is worth having while anything here is unconfirmed in
-- game: everything this window cannot do, the client's can, and it is one tick
-- box away.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The frames that make up the client's log. QuestLogFrame is the window;
-- QuestLogDetailFrame is the separate panel newer builds split the quest text
-- onto, and it is probed rather than assumed because Classic Era does not have
-- one. Every name is probed before it is touched, the same as the chat
-- window's furniture list.
local FRAMES = {
	"QuestLogFrame",
	"QuestLogDetailFrame",
}

-- What L does while the switch is on. A named function at file scope rather
-- than a closure made at the swap, which is what makes "are we already holding
-- it" a comparison.
local function Toggle()
	ns.QuestWindow.Toggle()
end

-- The mechanism is Core/BlizzAdapter.lua's cage shape, which the map's, the
-- sheet's, the book's and the talent window's use as well. Everything above is
-- why this frame is on that shape rather than the park one, and what is left
-- for this file to say is which frames, which switch, and what L does instead.
--
-- **Off the once-a-second walk.** The log is not a frame the client rebuilds
-- underneath us and there is no load-on-demand addon behind it, so the cage is
-- applied when the switch moves. Quests/Feature.lua and Quests/Window.lua are
-- what call it.
--
-- L is spelled out rather than read off the client, because this part has never
-- taken an override binding and has nothing to name a key with.

-- The client's on-screen tracker, which is a second frame and a second switch
--
-- QuestWatchFrame is the five lines of quest text the client draws down the
-- right of the screen. It is not the log window above and it does not follow
-- that window's switch, because the two are up in different states: the log is
-- a window you open and the watch frame arrives on its own, off `autoQuestWatch`
-- and the client's own QuestWatch_Update, in the middle of an evening.
--
-- **Questie used to hide it and stopped.** `QuestieInit:Init` calls
-- WatchFrameHook.Hide and `Questie:OnEnable` calls QuestieCompat.HideWatchFrame,
-- and both are behind `Questie.db.profile.trackerEnabled`. Quests/TrackerOff.lua
-- switches that setting off, which is what the box is for, so ticking it took
-- Blizzard's tracker off Questie's hands and gave it to nobody. That is the bug
-- this closes, and it is worth reading beside Quests/TrackerOff.lua's header:
-- the cost of reaching into a neighbour's setting is that you inherit what the
-- neighbour was doing with it.
--
-- **So it follows the tracker switch and not the window one.** `quests` and
-- `questsTrackerOff`, which is ns.QuestColumn.Wanted() by another name: the
-- state the hole opens in is exactly the state this addon's own column has the
-- screen. With that box unticked Questie's tracker is up and Questie hides the
-- client's frame itself, and with Questie absent the player keeps the client's
-- tracker, which is the right answer in both.
--
-- **Nothing takes a key.** There is no global that opens a watch frame and no
-- binding that shows one, so the descriptor carries no `global` and
-- Core/BlizzAdapter.lua's cage does the cage alone. That field being optional
-- is the one change this needed in the shape.
--
-- QuestTimerFrame is beside it because it is the same picture for a timed
-- quest, and it is the frame Questie's own WatchFrameHook hides in the same
-- call. A name this client does not carry costs one lookup against nil.
