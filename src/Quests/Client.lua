--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The client's quest log, asked once and asked properly
--
-- Every call this addon makes to the game's quest log is in this file, and no
-- other file in the folder touches a client API. That is the same seam
-- Mail/Send.lua draws, and it is drawn here for one extra reason: the quest log
-- has a global cursor, and a window that reads it without putting the cursor
-- back is a window that breaks every other addon reading the same log.
--
-- **The cursor.** SelectQuestLogEntry returns nothing. It moves a selection the
-- whole client shares, and GetQuestLogQuestText, every reward call and the
-- abandon pair all read whatever it is pointing at. Questie's own timer code
-- shows the etiquette: read GetQuestLogSelection, move it, take the reading,
-- move it back. Client.Borrow is that, once, so no caller can forget it.
--
-- **The indices move.** A collapsed header hides the quests under it from
-- GetQuestLogTitle entirely, so an index means nothing except against a log
-- with every header open. Questie expands them all before it hashes the log,
-- for this reason. Client.Open does the same and the model calls it before it
-- counts anything.
--
-- **What is named and what is probed.** GetNumQuestLogEntries and
-- GetQuestLogTitle are in src/.luacheckrc because Questie calls them unguarded
-- on both of the clients this addon ships for, which is this addon's standing
-- proof that a call exists. Everything else goes through _G and is type-checked
-- at its call site, because the two clients genuinely differ: TBC pays honor
-- for a quest and Classic Era does not, and neither client has a
-- GetQuestLogRewardXP at all until Questie's own LibQuestXP defines one.
--
-- So every function below answers nil where the call was missing, and nil is a
-- different answer from zero. A quest that pays no honor and a client that
-- cannot say are not the same fact, and the window draws them differently.

-- This is not the same function as Call and cannot be. Half the quest log API
-- is void: ExpandQuestHeader, the watch pair, QuestLogPushQuest and both halves
-- of the abandon all return nothing at all, so `Call(...) ~= nil` reads every
-- one of them as a failure. That bug shipped for about an hour and the harness
-- caught it on the one call where the difference is visible: the quest was
