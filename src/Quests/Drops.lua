-- What a creature is carrying that a quest of yours wants
--
-- Point at a boar and the client tells you it is a boar. What it does not tell
-- you is that eight of its hides are the difference between you and the end of
-- the quest in your log, that you already have three, and that the last four
-- boars had nothing on them. All three of those are things you know while you
-- are killing the boars and forget by the time you come back to the zone, and
-- the second one is the reason people open the quest log between pulls.
--
-- So this hangs three lines off the world hover, and each of them answers a
-- different question:
--
--   which quest   the name of the thing in your log this creature feeds
--   what for      the objective's own words, and the client's counter under
--                 them as collected of needed
--   how often     what fraction of the kills drop it
--
-- **All of it is Questie's and the client's, and none of it is guessed.**
--
-- Questie is the only thing on either client that knows a creature feeds a
-- quest at all. There is no API for it: the client will tell you what a quest
-- wants and never what carries it or where it walks. Questie carries a database
-- row per creature and registers, per objective, the key `m_<npc id>` against
-- every spawn that would tick it. That table is what this file reads, and reads
-- only: nothing here calls Update on one of Questie's objectives or writes a
-- field on it. A part that mutates another addon's state is a part that breaks
-- when the other addon changes and cannot be blamed for it.
--
-- **Every kind of objective, not only the ones that drop something.** Questie
-- files five kinds under that key and this file read one of them for a long
-- time, `item`, which is why the hover people actually wanted was the hover
-- that said nothing. A creature you have to kill eight of is a `monster`
-- objective, it is the commonest quest in the game, and it fell out one line
-- above the box being built. WANTED below is the list, and the reason it is a
-- list rather than a comparison is that the next kind Questie adds should show
-- up as a missing entry rather than as silence.
--
-- **The drop chance has two sources and they are not equal.** Questie v11 ships
-- a drop table -- three databases deep, keyed item then npc, reachable through
-- QuestieDB.GetItemDroprate -- and that is the number printed wherever it
-- answers, because it is there on the first hover. The note that used to stand
-- here said no database on either client carried one, and that was true of the
-- v6 this file was written against and is false of the v11 in the game.
--
-- Under it is the ledger, which is this addon's own and is counted rather than
-- looked up: every corpse of that creature you open the loot window on is one
-- sample and every one that had the item on it is a hit. It is what the box
-- says where Questie's table has no row, and it is printed beside Questie's
-- where both have an answer, because a rate scraped off a database and a rate
-- off four hundred of your own kills disagreeing is the single most useful
-- thing either of them can tell you.
--
-- It says nothing until it has enough corpses to be worth saying. A creature
-- you have looted twice with one drop is not a fifty percent drop rate, it is
-- two corpses, and a tooltip that rounds that to a number is a tooltip lying
-- with arithmetic. FLOOR is where it starts talking.
--
-- **Nothing here is a fallback.** With Questie absent, no line is drawn and the
-- box is the name and the client's own words, which is what it was before this
-- file existed. That is the shape every part of this addon that leans on
-- another one has: degrade to the box you would have had, never to a guess.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The fewest corpses before a fraction is worth printing. Ten is where a single
-- unlucky run stops being the whole of the answer: at ten, one drop reads as
-- ten percent and is somewhere between three and thirty, which is wide and is
-- at least the right order of magnitude. Below it the number would be noise
-- wearing a percent sign.
local FLOOR = 10

-- How many creatures the ledger keeps. It only ever writes a creature Questie
-- has said carries a quest item, which is hundreds over a whole character
-- rather than the tens of thousands of things you loot, but a saved variable
-- with no ceiling is a saved variable that is one day megabytes. Past this the
-- least useful row goes, which is the one with the fewest corpses on it: a
-- creature seen twice is worth less than the one you have killed four hundred
-- of, and it is also the one you are least likely to be standing in front of.

-- What a nameplate says
--
-- The hover has room for the quest's name, the objective's own sentence and two
-- drop rates. A bar over a mob's head has room for four characters, and the
-- four worth having are the count: `3/8` is both why you are pulling this one
-- and whether you still have to. Where the client has no count for the
-- objective -- an event, a thing you cast on it -- the mark on its own is the
-- whole answer, and the mark is what UnitFrames/EnemyBars.lua draws in quest
-- gold beside the bar.
--
-- **Cached, and the cache is the reason this is a separate function rather than
-- Lines with a shorter formatter.** It is asked once per plate five times a
-- second, and the walk behind it is over another addon's hash table with a
-- currentQuestlog lookup per entry. One table index per plate per tick is what
-- the answer costs once the walk has happened, and the walk happens once per
-- creature per change to your log.
--
-- Thrown away whole on QUEST_LOG_UPDATE, which is the one event that covers
-- every way the answer can move: accepting, abandoning, handing in, and killing
-- the seventh of eight. It fires often enough that a creature answered before
-- Questie had compiled its database is re-asked a moment later, which is the
-- other half of what the wipe is for.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- False rather than nil for a creature no quest wants, so that "asked and the
-- answer was no" is a hit and not a miss. A creature with nothing on it is the
-- overwhelming majority of what a plate is put up for.
