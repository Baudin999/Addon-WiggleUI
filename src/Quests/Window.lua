--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The quest log
--
-- Three columns: what you are on, what this one says, and what it pays.
--
-- **The client's log is six lines and a scrollbar.** That is the whole reason
-- this exists. Twenty quests do not fit in six lines, so the log you are
-- carrying is something you scroll a strip to see one eighth of, and the text
-- of the quest you clicked appears in the same window by pushing the list off
-- it. Every question a player actually opens the log to answer is a question
-- about the whole log at once. What can I hand in. What is near here. What have
-- I outlevelled. None of them can be asked of six lines.
--
-- So the left column is the log, all of it, zone by zone, and it does not move
-- when you click something. Sixty rows fit where the client drew six.
--
-- Above the zones go the quests you have pinned, in the order you pinned them,
-- and only where you have pinned one. That group is the answer to "what am I
-- always watching" without scrolling for it, which is the question the pin is
-- there to answer; a mark on a row is only an answer once you have found the
-- row. A pinned quest is drawn in the group and again under its zone, because
-- a quest that moved when you pinned it is a quest you then have to find.
--
-- **The middle column is the objectives first and the story second.** The
-- client puts the giver's four paragraphs at the top and the list of what to
-- kill underneath, which is the right order the first time you read it and the
-- wrong order the other forty. You have read the story. What you came back for
-- is three of eight, so three of eight is at the top.
--
-- **And behind a tab, it is a map instead.** Three of eight what, and where. A
-- quest log answers the first and has never answered the second on any client:
-- the text says Kobold Miners and the world does not label them, so the answer
-- has always been a second addon, or a second window, or a website. Questie
-- already knows every spawn of every one of them and spends that on icons
-- scattered over the world map, where you have to go and find the quest again
-- among the other nineteen. This draws the zone at the size of one column with
-- that one quest's places on it, which is the same data asked the other way
-- round: not "what is in this zone" but "where is this quest".
--
-- The tab is two words and it stays where you left it. A player who wants the
-- map wants it for the next quest too, so clicking down the left column keeps
-- whichever side you are on and redraws it.
--
-- **The right column is the payoff and the where.** Rewards alone would leave
-- it empty for the many quests that pay coin and nothing else, which is a third
-- of a window spent on white space. Under them goes the one thing the client
-- cannot answer and Questie can: who takes this back, and how far away the
-- nearest thing you still have to kill is. Quests/Where.lua reads that, and
-- both lines are simply absent when Questie is not installed.
--
-- **The two right-hand columns are one pool of rows.** A quest's text is
-- between three and thirty lines and its rewards are between none and six, so
-- the obvious way to draw them is to build the frames the quest needs and throw
-- them away on the next click. This client cannot destroy a frame. Thrown away
-- means leaked, and leaked once per quest you click all evening. So there is
-- one row frame per line of each column, built once, carrying every region
-- either kind of line can want, and a click repaints them rather than making
-- any. It is the same argument UI/Window.lua's list makes, one layer down.
--
-- **Nothing here is on a ticker.** The log changes when the server says it
-- changed, which is four events, and every one of them ends in Refresh.
-- Questie's own quest update is a fifth and is not a ticker either: it says a
-- quest was accepted, updated, turned in or abandoned, and it says it after
-- Questie has redone the answers the right column draws. The
-- distance in the right column is the one number that goes stale between
-- events, and it is redrawn when you click a quest rather than five times a
-- second, because a quest log open on the screen is not a compass.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How big the window is.
--
-- It grew, and the map is the whole reason. The two side columns are fixed, so
-- every pixel of width and height added here lands on the middle one, and the
-- middle one at 810 by 520 drew a zone about three hundred pixels across: wide
-- enough to say which end of Westfall and not wide enough to say which side of
-- the road. A zone at five hundred is the picture the wheel then works on top
-- of rather than the picture the wheel has to rescue.
--
-- Still smaller than the dungeon log beside it, which is 1180 by 660, so this
-- is not the widest thing the addon puts on the screen.
local WIDTH, HEIGHT = 1000, 640

-- The two fixed columns. The middle takes whatever is left, which is the way
-- round it has to be: a zone name and an item name have a length the font
-- decides, and prose does not.
--
-- The list is thirty pixels wider than it was and the window is thirty wider
-- with it, so the middle column comes out at the width it always had. That is
-- what the three things on the right of a row cost: the number of party members
-- on the quest, the share mark and the abandon mark. Taking it out of the
-- middle instead would have paid for them with the map.
local LIST, PAY = 250, 200

-- One reward's picture, and the mark down the left of an objective line. Both
-- are the width their column reserves before the words start, so the ticks line
-- up down one edge and the icons down the other.
local SLOT, MARK = 22, 10

-- The tick, in the one place both columns read it from. It is a `V` because
-- that is the letter Media/Glyphs.ttf cuts the Font Awesome check onto, and a
-- `V` is what a client that refuses the font draws instead. Nothing here has to
-- know either of those things beyond this line.
local TICK = "V"

-- The pin's own mark, and the heading it draws under.
--
-- A circle because Media/Glyphs.ttf is a subset of seventeen marks and none of
-- them is a pin. Adding one means rebaking the font and moving the list
-- scripts/check.sh holds UI.GLYPHS to, which is a change to the font policy
-- rather than to this window. A gold dot in the same column the tick uses says
-- "yours" at a glance and costs nothing.
local PIN = "o"

-- What the pinned group is called. One word, because the column is 250 pixels
-- wide and the zone headers beside it are place names.
local PINNED = "Pinned"

-- The character in front of a row, and the whole of what says a quest is

--
-- The colour said it first and the colour could not carry it. A quest ready to
-- hand in is drawn in C.tick, which is a green two shades off the green the
-- level ladder gives every quest a few levels under you, so a log of grey
-- quests you have outlevelled is a log where nothing stands out. And the row
-- you have selected drops its own tint for the heading colour, so the one quest
-- you were reading was the one quest that could not tell you at all.
--
-- The mark is the same tick the objective lines use and the same width on every
-- row, finished or not, so the levels stay in a column. It was a "+" until the
-- glyph face learned a tick, and a plus is the mark for adding a thing rather
-- than for having finished one.
--
-- The pin is third of three and takes the column only where the quest has
-- nothing more urgent to say. One glyph fits and a quest ready to hand in has
-- to keep the tick: that is the fact the colour could not carry and the reason
-- this region exists. The pin loses nothing by giving way, because the group at

-- The client's four stay. Questie may not be installed, may be v6, and may be
-- twenty seconds from compiling its database at the moment you press L, and a
-- quest log that redraws only when another addon says so is a blank window on
-- all three. This sharpens the first source; it does not replace it.
--
-- The three arguments go unread. Questie hands over the quest id, an objective
-- index and one of Questie.API.Enums.QuestUpdateTriggerReason, and all four of
-- those reasons change what the left column says, so there is no reason to
-- refuse any of them and no partial repaint to spend one on.
--
-- Readiness is the one question this addon does not probe again for. The rule
-- at ns.Questie is that nothing about Questie is cached, because the database
-- compiles minutes after login and an answer taken before it is wrong for the
-- rest of the session; RegisterOnReady is that same argument answered from the
-- other end, by the database itself, once, at the moment it finishes.
