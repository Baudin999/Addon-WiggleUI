--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Your quest log, as a shape rather than as a list of rows
--
-- The client hands the log over as a flat run of rows where a header is a row
-- like any other and the quests under it are the rows that follow until the
-- next header. That shape is why the client's own log is a scrolling strip of
-- six lines: it has nothing to draw except the run.
--
-- This file turns it into zones, each holding its quests, which is the shape
-- the window's left column draws and the shape a player already has in their
-- head. Nothing else here is clever. The whole of the work is the two things
-- Quests/Client.lua explains: every header has to be open before the rows mean
-- anything, and the cursor has to go back where it was found.
--
-- **The selection is a quest id, never an index.** An index is a position in a
-- list that moves whenever you accept or hand in anything, so a window holding
-- one is a window that changes which quest it is showing while you read it.
-- The id survives all of that. Where the client will not give an id, which is
-- the older builds, the title is the fallback key and the failure that leaves
-- is two quests of the same name in two zones, which is a smaller wrong answer
-- than the index gives on every turn-in.
--
-- **What is cached and what is not.** The zones are, because the left column
-- rebuilds from them on every event and walking sixty rows to redraw one tick
-- box is the kind of waste this addon has a gate for. One quest's text and
-- rewards are not: they are read when you click a quest and thrown away, both
-- because they are two borrows of a shared cursor and because a cache of them
-- would need invalidating on the events that are exactly the reason the window
-- redraws.

-- matching its own selection.

-- read down the level: what you can do now and what you came back for later is
-- the first cut anybody makes over a quest log.
--
-- An elite quest carries a "+" inside the brackets, which is the same suffix
-- Unit/Level.lua puts on an elite mob's level and is read the same way: a level
-- you cannot take alone. The tag is ns.QuestWhere.Tag's answer and is handed in
-- rather than asked here, because Where loads after this file and the window
-- reads the same tag again for its tagline.
--

-- a tracker that spelled it differently was a quest read two ways.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The two facts about a quest that are not on its own row.
--
-- Whether it can be handed to the party comes off the shared cursor, so all of
-- them are asked in one sweep rather than one borrow each: the left column
-- draws a share mark on the rows that can take one, and that is a question per
-- quest on every rebuild.
--
-- Who else in the group is on it, and how far along, comes off
-- Quests/Party.lua, which asks the client and Questie and merges what both say.
-- Both are read here rather than in Detail, because the row in the left column
-- and every quest on the tracker draw it, and Detail is only ever asked about
-- the one quest you are reading. This is the one read both drawings share.

-- The pin
--
-- The quests you want in front of you, saved on this character and held here

--
-- **The client's watch list is not written.** AddQuestWatch caps at five and
-- Questie replaces GetNumQuestWatches outright to get out from under that cap,
-- which is a fight with the client this addon is not joining. Client.Watch and
-- Client.Watched stay on Quests/Client.lua unused, so the day the trade turns
-- out to be the wrong one, writing both is one line here.
--
-- The cost of not writing it is real and the options panel says so: Questie's
-- map icons can be filtered down to tracked quests, and a pin does not reach
-- that filter because the client does not know about it.
--
-- Keyed on the quest key, which is the id where the client gives one, for the
-- reason at the head of this file: an index is a position and every turn-in
-- moves it. A list rather than a map, because the order you pinned them in is
-- the order the pinned group draws and a map has no order. Uncapped, which is
-- the whole point of it being ours.
