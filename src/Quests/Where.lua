--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Where the quest actually is, borrowed from Questie
--
-- This addon does not replace Questie and will not try to. Questie carries a
-- quest database and draws the map icons, and both of those are the reason it
-- is installed. What it also carries, and barely uses, is the answer to the one
-- question a quest log cannot answer on its own: where do I go.
--
-- The client will tell you a quest wants eight Kobold Miners. It will not tell
-- you where a Kobold Miner is, who takes the quest back, or which of the eleven
-- things in your log is nearest to where you are standing. Questie knows all
-- three and spends them on a tracker sorted by zone.
--
-- So this file is a reader and nothing else. Four facts come out of it:
--
--   the finisher   who or what you hand the quest to, off the quest object's
--                  own Finisher, which Questie fills in with the name already
--                  resolved.
--   the tag        what kind of quest it is, which is the word "Elite" and the
--                  handful like it, off Questie's corrected wrapper around the
--                  client's own call.
--   the nearest    the closest thing that would tick an objective, and how far
--                  away it is, off QuestieMap:GetNearestQuestSpawn.
--   the places     every spawn the quest has, grouped by the zone it is in and
--                  translated into the map id the client draws that zone under.
--                  This is the one Questie has and never shows you as a list:
--                  it draws them on the world map as icons and the tracker
--                  turns them into a single line of text.
--
-- **Every one of them degrades to nil.** Questie may not be installed, may be a
-- version whose internals moved, or may not have compiled its database yet, and
-- a quest log that raises because another addon changed a field name is a
-- quest log that has made the player's evening worse for no gain. Nil is drawn
-- as a column with a line missing, and that is the whole cost.
--
-- **Nothing here is cached.** Comfort/Clutter.lua makes the same call and
-- carries the reason: the database is compiled after login, so an answer taken
-- too early is wrong for the rest of the session. The distance has a second
-- reason on top of that one, which is that it changes every step you take.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Past this, Questie is telling you the thing is on another continent. Its own
-- distance function adds half a million yards to a spawn outside your instance
-- so that anything local always sorts first, and reading that number as a
-- distance would put "483,204 yards" under a quest name.
local ELSEWHERE = 500000

-- What a place on the map is for. Taken from the widget that draws them rather
-- than written out again here: UI/Chart.lua keys its palette on these three
-- strings, and two copies of the same word is one edit away from a dot with no
-- colour, which is a dot nobody can read.
Where.TODO = ns.UI.Chart.TODO -- something you still have to kill, pick up or click
Where.BACK = ns.UI.Chart.BACK -- who the quest goes back to
Where.YOU  = ns.UI.Chart.YOU  -- where you are standing, which no database knows

-- Which of Questie's own marks a kind of objective is drawn with.
--
-- The map beside this one gets its icons for free: Map/Pins.lua walks Questie's
-- own frames and the texture is on them. Nothing here has a frame to read. The
-- places below come out of the database, one query at a time, for a quest
-- Questie may never have drawn a single icon for, and what the database carries
-- is the kind of thing rather than the picture.
--
-- So the kind is turned into the name Questie files its art under, and
-- ns.QuestieIcon turns that into a path. The five names are Questie's own and
-- the mapping is Questie's own too: its `objectiveSpawnListCallTable` gives a
-- creature the slay icon, an object the object icon, an item the loot icon and
-- a trigger the event icon, and a kill credit is a creature by another name.
--
-- Where the data says which icon rather than which kind, that wins. A live
-- spawn list entry carries `Icon` and an ObjectiveData row carries one where
-- Questie's corrections have overridden the default, and those are the whole
-- reason a "kill the four guards" step draws a loot mark on the real map: the
-- correction is the answer and the kind is the guess.

-- you at forty murlocs has forty database rows inside one camp, and forty dots

-- What kind of quest this is, in the client's own word, or nothing at all for

--
-- "Elite" is the one that matters, and it is a fact about the walk rather than
-- about the quest text: an elite camp is a crossing of the zone and a corpse
-- run back, and the word is the only thing that says so before you get there.
--
-- Here rather than beside whichever box drew it first, because three boxes draw
-- it. The marker hover on the world map, the creature hover out in the world
-- and the line under a quest's name in the log are all naming the same quest,
-- and a word that came off a different call in each is three answers that
-- disagree the day Blizzard tags one wrongly.
--
-- Asked through Questie rather than by calling GetQuestTagInfo here, for two
-- reasons that are both Questie's own. It caches, and this is asked once per
-- marker over a zone that can hold two hundred and fifty of them, against an
-- API the client throttles. And it corrects the quests Blizzard has tagged
-- wrongly, which is a list this addon has no business keeping a second copy of.
--
-- **The first ask about a quest always answers nothing.** The client's own call
-- returns nil the first time it is asked and Questie says so in its wrapper: it
-- schedules one retry a second later and caches what that gets. So the answer
-- is worth asking for twice, and a caller that asks once while it is building
-- something is a caller that has warmed the cache rather than one that has
-- failed. Every box below asks again at the moment it draws the words.
--
-- The word is whatever the client hands back, with one exception, and the
-- exception is the one tag anybody cares about. The client has two calls that
-- name a quest's tag and they do not agree: GetQuestTagInfo calls tag 1
-- "Group", and GetQuestLogTitle, which is what Blizzard's own quest log prints
-- in brackets after the name, calls the same quest elite. Elite is also the
-- word the game uses for the mobs that make the walk what it is, and it is the
-- word the player is looking for. So that one id is named here and every other
-- tag keeps the client's own word, which is what stops this file inventing a
-- name for a tag it has never seen.
local ELITE = 1

-- The word itself, named here because two files test for it. Quests/Window.lua

-- Questie's own answer to "where next", unpicked: the zone it is in, what it
-- is called and how far away it is.
--
-- Its own function because two callers want different thirds of it. The right
-- column draws the name and the distance on one line; the map wants only the
-- zone, so that the zone it opens on is the one you would walk to.
--
-- A quest that is already complete answers with its finisher instead, which is
-- Questie's behaviour rather than a choice made here: once there is nothing
-- left to kill, the nearest thing that matters is the person waiting for you.
--
-- **It moved out of QuestieMap and shed two returns.** v6 answered this on the
-- map module as GetNearestQuestSpawn and handed back six things, of which this
-- wanted the second, third and sixth. v11 keeps it in DistanceUtils, calls it
-- GetNearestSpawnForQuest, takes no self and returns four: the coordinate pair,
-- the area, the name and the distance. Read the old way the module answered a
-- table with no such function in it and every quest reported no destination.
--
-- **Asked at most once a second, and that is not a nicety.** The walk behind
-- it reads every spawn of every objective still open, through a zone to world
-- coordinate transform per pair, which on an ordinary kill objective is
-- hundreds of them. Two callers in the quest window's paint made a paint cost
-- two of these walks. There is one caller now, drawing the one selected quest,
-- and scripts/check.sh counts them so it stays one. A paint is what
-- QUEST_LOG_UPDATE ends in, and that event is not the log changing: it is the
-- client saying it looked, several times a second while you are killing things.
-- The whole cost arrived the day the name above was corrected, because the
-- wrong name cost nothing, and it landed as a stutter in the world rather than
-- as anything wrong in the window.
--
-- One slot, because the window draws one quest at a time and clicking a
-- different one is a different quest table, which is a miss and is answered
-- fresh. Nothing is held across the second, so a quest handed in or abandoned
-- cannot be answered for: Quest above reads the live log and returns nil first.
--
-- A second of staleness on a yardage is nothing. Standing still it is the same
-- number, and running flat out it is seven yards off a figure that is already
-- only as exact as a spawn table's idea of where a mob stands.
