-- Strips the 2007 furniture off the action bars: the two gryphons, the riveted
-- metal strip behind bar 1, the page arrows and the page number. None of it
-- carries information, and a row of icons only reads as a row of icons once it
-- is gone. On by default, because that is the look the loadout was designed
-- for, and reversible in one call because every other part of this addon is.
--
-- Three rules shape the file.
--
--   Textures go, frames stay. Bar 1, the micro menu and the bag bar are all
--   anchored to MainMenuBarArtFrame in both saved Edit Mode layouts, so hiding
--   that frame would take them with it. Its textures are hidden one by one and
--   the frame stays where the anchors expect to find it.
--
--   Walk the regions, do not name them. This client is a hybrid: TBC art under
--   a backported Edit Mode, so a texture global the wiki names may not be the
--   one 2.5.6 has. GetRegions cannot go stale, and every name below is resolved
--   through _G so a missing one is a skipped entry rather than an error.
--
--   The experience bar is not artwork. MainMenuExpBar and
--   StatusTrackingBarManager are deliberately absent from both lists.
--
--   A named region goes through the attic, a walked one does not. ns.Strip
--   puts a region's own Hide where its Show was and loses to SetShown, which is
--   resolved in C and reads no Lua field; that is why the page arrows and the
--   page number were still on the screen with this switch in its default state.
--   Core/Attic.lua re-parents into a frame that can never be shown, which no
--   call on the frame itself undoes, and Core/BlizzHide.lua's sweep then keeps
--   them there for free. It only takes frames, so the endcaps and the sliding
--   textures fall back to ns.Strip inside the same call and the list does not
--   have to know which of the two this client made them.
--
--   The textures inside the holders keep ns.Strip on purpose. A texture is a
--   region of the frame it was created on and re-parenting one takes it out of
--   that frame's draw order rather than off the screen, which is the rule
--   Core/Attic.lua's own header states.
