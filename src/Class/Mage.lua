-- Mage
--
-- Three of the seven fields, and the four that are missing are the point of the
-- registry: a mage has no stances, no opener the charge button could cast, no
-- ability that opens on a dodge and nothing that casts inside a swing. Four
-- parts of the addon read those fields, find nothing, and are not built. No
-- secure button, no nameplate scan, no combat log handler, no page in the
-- options window.
--
-- Blink is deliberately not a charge. The charge button is three abilities that
-- close on a unit, aimed by the camera and swapped into a stance on the way;
-- Blink goes where you are facing and takes no target at all, so putting it
-- behind that machinery would be a button that ignores everything the machinery
-- is for.
--
-- Three specs, and only one of them carries a bar plan. The plan below is
-- written off the frost mage somebody here plays; a fire or arcane plan written
-- from a talent calculator would fill your bars with a guess and take a backup
-- you then have to put back, which is the argument Class\Priest.lua makes for
-- refusing a plan altogether. So those two open no loadout page and the refusal
-- names the spec.
--
-- The cooldown lists and the debuff rows are written for all three, because
-- being wrong there costs an empty square rather than your bars.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The bar plan
--
-- Frost, because that is what this one is levelled as, and one page because a
-- mage has nothing to page between. Same shape as any other plan: one row per
-- physical key, and the role is what the key is for.
--
-- index 1 to 12 is the physical slot, which on this install is E Q Z X C V F
-- 1 2 3 4 5.

	-- What this class adds to the upkeep row
	--
	-- The armour spell, and it is exactly what this row is for: it is silent
	-- when it lapses, it is expensive while it is lapsed, and it comes off on
	-- every death and every dispel. Four spells and any one of them clears the
	-- square, because which armour you are running is a choice and this row does
	-- not have opinions about choices.
	--
	-- Rank 1 of each, because the match is by name and every rank shares one.
	-- 168 Frost Armor, 7302 Ice Armor, 6117 Mage Armor, 30482 Molten Armor. The
	-- last is Burning Crusade only and simply never resolves on Classic Era,
	-- which costs nothing: an id this client cannot name is left out of the
	-- table and the other three still answer.

	-- The three specs
	--
	-- Tree order, which is the order the client counts them in and the order the
	-- resolver falls back on: 1 arcane, 2 fire, 3 frost.
	--
	-- Eight cooldowns used to sit on one list here and IsSpellKnown sorted them
	-- out, which worked and said nothing. A frost mage got Evocation, Ice Block,
	-- Cold Snap and Icy Veins because those are the four a frost mage has, not
	-- because anything in the addon knew what a frost mage is. Now it does, and
	-- the row is short by design rather than by accident.
	--
	-- The ids, all from Wowhead's Classic and TBC Classic databases: 12051
	-- Evocation, 45438 Ice Block, 11958 Cold Snap, 12472 Icy Veins, 12042 Arcane
	-- Power, 12043 Presence of Mind, 11129 Combustion, 66 Invisibility.
	--
	-- Ice Block carries two ids for the one entry. 45438 is what both of these
	-- clients answer for it and 27619 is the older number the same spell has been
	-- filed under, and the list takes whichever one this client knows.
	-- Invisibility is Burning Crusade only and never resolves on Era, which costs
	-- one square on one client and nothing else.
	--
	-- Each signature is a single rank talent nobody in another tree can have.
	-- Arcane carries two because Presence of Mind sits fifteen points up and
	-- Arcane Power at thirty, so a levelling arcane mage is named by the first of
	-- them long before the second.
