-- Shaman
--
-- Three of the seven fields, for the same reason the mage file has three:
-- nothing here opens on a dodge, nothing casts inside a swing, and nothing
-- closes on a unit the way the charge button's three do.
--
-- Ghost Wolf is deliberately not a form. GetShapeshiftForm counts it, so the
-- client would answer 1 for a shaman running between mobs, but `forms` exists
-- for two things and Ghost Wolf serves neither: bar 1 does not page into it,
-- because the bonus bar offset stays 0, and a weapon set bound to it would be a
-- loadout you can only press while you are a wolf and cannot swing anything.
-- Listing it would seed a loadout row nobody wants and offer a stance page that
-- does not exist.
--
-- The weapon imbue is not here either, and that is the shipped row doing its
-- job. A bare main hand is already the first entry on the buff nag, and it says
-- so in its own hint: a sharpening stone, an oil and a shaman's imbue are the
-- same fact about the same slot, read out of the same call.
--
-- Three specs, and the split between what this file says and what each of them
-- says is worth stating. The shield square on the buff row is here, because all
-- three want one and none of them cares which. Everything a spec disagrees
-- about is written inside it: the four cooldowns worth counting, the debuffs
-- worth a square above a mob, and the bar plan.
--
-- And one field no other class file writes yet. `standing` is the four totem
-- slots, which is a fact about being a shaman in the way the three stances are
-- a fact about being a warrior, and it is the first thing in this addon that
-- both classes will fill in. Standing\Standing.lua reads it and knows the word
-- totem nowhere.
--
-- The bar plan lives inside enhancement and nowhere else. That is the same
-- decision Class\Priest.lua takes for the whole class: the plan below is
-- written off a character somebody plays, and an elemental plan written from a
-- talent calculator would fill your bars with a guess and take a backup you
-- then have to put back. So an elemental shaman opens no loadout page and the
-- refusal names the spec. Somebody who levels one writes the plan.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The bar plan
--
-- Enhancement, because that is what this one is levelled as, and one page: a
-- shaman has nothing to page between.
--
-- Bar 2 is nine totems and three spells, which is what a shift layer is for on
-- this class. Nothing on these clients drops a set in one press, so each is its
-- own square and they sit together where the fingers can find them.
--
-- index 1 to 12 is the physical slot, which on this install is E Q Z X C V F
-- 1 2 3 4 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The four slots
--
-- What Standing\Standing.lua draws a square for, and the whole of what this
-- addon knows about a totem.
--
-- `index` is the client's own slot number and not ours to choose: the constants
-- in the 2.5.6 interface are FIRE_TOTEM_SLOT 1, EARTH_TOTEM_SLOT 2,
-- WATER_TOTEM_SLOT 3 and AIR_TOTEM_SLOT 4, and GetTotemInfo counts in those.
--
-- The order they are written in is the order they are drawn in, and it is
-- Blizzard's rather than the numbers': SHAMAN_TOTEM_PRIORITIES is earth, fire,
-- water, air. A shaman has read their totems in that order for twenty years and
-- an addon that renumbered them would be teaching a second order for the same
-- four things. It is also the order that reads best, because earth and fire are
-- the two you drop every pull and they land where the eye starts.
--
-- The colour is the only thing an empty slot has to say. It is here rather than
-- in the row because the row has no opinion about elements: a stance plan will
-- hand it three different colours and neither list belongs to a file that draws
-- squares. Four hues far enough apart to be told apart in one pixel of hairline
-- over a dark floor.
--
-- `kind` names the reader. There is one today and the shape of the field is the
-- point: a warrior's three stances are the same question with a different
-- source, and they are a second reader and a second table like this one rather
-- than a second part of the addon.

-- of the four are Burning Crusade only, so an Era shaman sees the one that was
-- always there and nothing is wrong: an id this client cannot name draws no
-- square.
--
-- Bloodlust and Heroism are one entry with two ids, because they are the same
-- button on two factions and a shaman has exactly one of them. The entry takes
-- whichever this character knows, which is what the two id form is for.
