-- What the addon knows about a class
--
-- Seven things in this addon are facts about a warrior rather than facts about
-- Warcraft: the three stance spells, the three abilities the charge button
-- casts, the two abilities a fight hands you, the one that waits on the
-- target's health, the three that eat a white swing, Battle Shout on the
-- upkeep row, and the bar plan. Until now each lived in the file that used it and each
-- asked ns.IsWarrior for itself, so the addon knew it was a warrior addon in
-- six places and there was nowhere to write down a seventh class.
--
-- So a class is one table, registered from one file, and the parts read fields
-- off it. Class\Warrior.lua is the whole of what this addon knows about a
-- warrior and nothing outside it names a warrior spell.
--
-- The split is between facts and mechanism, and it is the only rule here worth
-- stating. A class file holds ids, names and plans. It holds no frames, no
-- events and no drawing. The charge button's camera aiming, the reaction
-- windows' combat log parse and the loadout's cursor handling are mechanism and
-- stay where they are, because they are the same code whoever is standing in
-- them.
--
-- A class that registers nothing is a supported class. It gets the ten parts of
-- the addon that never ask, and the parts that do ask find no field and do not
-- build. That is what makes adding a class additive: one file, no edits
-- anywhere else.
--
-- A class may also register `specs`, and every field above may be written again
-- inside one of them. Class.Of asks the spec first, per field, so a spec says
-- only what it disagrees with and a class with no specs behaves as it always
-- did. Which spec you are playing is Spec.lua's question and nothing outside
-- Class/ asks it.

-- The two constructors a loadout is built out of
--
-- Here rather than in Buttons\Layout.lua because every class file writes a plan
-- and none of them may name a file outside Class\. Each cell of a plan is
-- { kind, name }, where kind is "spell" or "macro" and nil is a slot the plan
-- leaves alone.
--
-- Names are English because this install is enUS. A localised client needs the
-- names swapping, which is the one thing about a plan that is not locale-proof.

-- One call per class file, at load. Two files claiming the same token is a bug
-- in the addon rather than a state to recover from, so it is an error at load
-- and not a silent overwrite: the second table would win, the first would go
-- quiet, and nothing on screen would say which.
--
-- label is the addon's own word for the class, lower case, and it is what the
-- refusals read out. The client's own localised name is Class.Name and is what
-- the rail is titled with, because a rail entry is a proper noun and a sentence
-- in the middle of a refusal is not.
--
-- `specs` is checked here and read in Spec.lua, and the three fields it insists
-- on are the three the resolver reads: a key to type at a slash word, a label
-- to read out, and the tree that answers when no signature spell does. A spec
-- that filled none of them in would never be picked and nothing on screen would
-- say why, which is a load error rather than a state to recover from.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Which class this is
--
-- Held once the client has answered, and asked again every time until it has.
--
-- Both halves matter. Class data is not reliable while the files load, so an
-- answer taken then would be nil, and a nil written down once would lock a
-- warrior out of the charge button for the rest of the session. That is the bug
-- this used to guard against by never holding anything at all.
--
-- Never holding anything is the wrong price now. The swing timer asks what you
-- are on the way to deciding where a band goes, which is ten times a second, and
-- a character does not change class between two of those. So the first answer
-- that is not nil is the answer, and every call after it is a local read.
--
-- The guard on the rest of the addon is when it asks, not what this returns.
-- Ask at PLAYER_LOGIN or later, never at file scope, and never cache the answer
-- of your own. A nil here does not mean no, it means the client has not said
-- yet, so anything that would turn a nil into a decision it then writes down
-- has to ask for the token first. UnitFrames\EnemyBars.lua is the shape of that:
-- it seeds a saved list off the spec the first time the list is read, so it asks
-- for the token before it writes anything down and records nothing on a nil.
--
-- There was a Class.Is(want) here that answered true on a nil for that reason,
-- and nothing called it. Every part that decides at login goes through Class.Of,
-- which answers nil, so the guard sat in a function outside the path while the
-- path itself had none. Timing and that one explicit check are the guard.

-- What this character's class brought
--

-- field that class did not fill in. Both are asked on demand rather than held
-- at login, because both are a table lookup on top of Token and Token is the
-- one thing here worth holding.
--
-- Nil is the whole gate. A part that wants a fact asks for it, gets nil, and
-- does not build: no frame, no ticker, no page, and no setting that writes a
-- value nothing on this character reads.

-- Field by field, and the spec is asked first.
--
-- Per field rather than per table, because a spec says only what it disagrees
-- with. An arms warrior and a protection warrior stand in the same three
-- stances and want the same square on the buff row, so neither file writes
-- `forms` or `upkeep` again; they disagree about which four cooldowns are worth
-- counting and which debuffs are worth a square, and those are the two fields
-- they write.
--
-- Nil is still the whole gate, and it now has two doors rather than one. A part
-- that finds nothing here does not build, whether that is because the class
-- registered no such fact or because the spec you are playing put nothing in
-- its place. The second is deliberate: a mage plan written for frost is a wrong
-- plan on an arcane mage, and no plan at all is the honest answer until
-- somebody plays one and writes it down.

-- The addon's own word for what you are, for a refusal to read out. Falls back

--
-- Whatever comes back has to be a noun phrase that follows an indefinite
-- article, because five of the sentences that read it put one in front: "a
-- warrior", "a mage", and before the client answers, "a character of unknown
-- class". The last fallback used to be "this character", so all five read "a
-- this character" for as long as the client stayed quiet. Section 21 gates the
