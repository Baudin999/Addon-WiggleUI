-- Warrior
--
-- Everything this addon knows about a warrior, and the only file in it that
-- names a warrior spell. Nine fields, each read by exactly one part:
--
--   forms      Core\Stance.lua, and through it the charge macro
--   charge     Charge\Charge.lua
--   reactive   Buttons\Reaction.lua
--   requires   Buttons\Requires.lua
--   swing      Swing\Slam.lua
--   upkeep     Buffs\Upkeep.lua, added to the row everybody gets
--   rotation   Cooldowns\Cooldowns.lua, the big squares on the top line
--   cooldowns  Cooldowns\Cooldowns.lua, the small ones docked under them
--   debuffs    UnitFrames\EnemyBars.lua, the row above a mob's bar
--   loadout    Buttons\Layout.lua
--
-- Six of them are the same whatever you have spent your points on and are
-- written here. Three are not and are written inside `specs` at the foot of the
-- file, which Class\Spec.lua picks between.
--
-- No frames, no events, no drawing. A class file is facts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The bar plan
--
-- The whole design of the loadout is this table. Changing what a key does is
-- editing data, not code.
--
-- Bar 1 pages by stance, so it is written as one row per physical key with a
-- cell per page: same finger, same job, in every stance. The role is what the
-- key is for and it is what makes the three cells a row rather than three
-- unrelated spells. Bar 2 is the shift layer and does not page, which is the
-- point of it.
--
-- index 1 to 12 is the physical slot, which on this install is E Q Z X C V F
-- 1 2 3 4 5.

	-- The two abilities the fight hands you
	--
	-- Overpower opens when your target dodges you. Revenge is the same
	-- mechanism from the other side and opens when you block, dodge or parry.
	-- Nothing else a warrior owns works this way, and `on` names which of the
	-- two triggers Buttons\Reaction.lua watches for each.
	--
	-- Rank 1 of each. Every other rank is matched by name against these, so
	-- this carries two ids rather than a rank list that goes stale at the next
	-- trainer visit.
	--
	-- Five seconds, and the sources do not agree. Every player-facing figure
	-- says five: the Vanilla wiki gives Overpower a "5 second period", every
	-- Classic warrior guide says the same, and both abilities carry a five
	-- second cooldown, so a warrior who presses on every window presses exactly
	-- on the cooldown. Against that, MaNGOS and TrinityCore both hold
	-- REACTIVE_TIMER_START at 4000 milliseconds.
	--
	-- Five is the number here because the two errors do not cost the same.
	-- Running a second long means a square says pressable when it is not, which
	-- costs a glance. Running a second short means the square goes grey while a
	-- free five rage attack is still sitting there, which costs the attack. A
	-- bar exists to show you the press, so it errs towards showing it. Settling
	-- it needs the live client and a stopwatch, and the README lists it under
	-- what has never been measured.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-- What the fight has to have done before the press lands
	--
	-- Read by Buttons\Requires.lua, which owns what a condition means and knows
	-- none of the abilities. One ability on a warrior meets the bar for being
	-- here, and the bar is that the client has no opinion and the answer is a
	-- fact rather than a guess.
	--
	-- Execute, rank 1, because every rank is called Execute and is matched by
	-- name against this one. Twenty percent is the number in its own tooltip on
	-- both of these clients and it is the whole rule: nothing about rage, nothing
	-- about stance and nothing about talents moves it. Without this the square
	-- drew ready from the pull, which is a bar shouting the one thing it should
	-- stay quiet about for four fifths of a fight.
	--
	-- Nothing else a warrior owns belongs here yet. Overpower and Revenge are
	-- next door in `reactive` because a window that arrives down the combat log
	-- is a clock and not a reading. Pummel and Shield Bash look like candidates
	-- and are deliberately absent: whether either may be pressed at a target
	-- that is not casting differs between these two clients and nobody here has
	-- measured it, and a square greyed on a rule the addon guessed at is worse
	-- than one that says nothing.
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	requires = {
		{ spell = 5308, below = 20 }, -- Execute, rank 1
	},

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-- The cast that lives inside a swing
	--
	-- Slam, rank one. Only the name is taken off it and every rank shares that
	-- name, so one id covers a warrior at level 30 and one at 70.
	--
	-- perPoint is what one point of Improved Slam takes off the cast, in
	-- seconds. Warcraft wiki's rank table gives 0.1 per point across five
	-- points for Classic and for Burning Crusade, and dates the two point, 0.5
	-- per point version to patch 3.0.2, which is one expansion past both of
	-- these clients. Wowhead's TBC entry for spell 12330 reads -1000
	-- milliseconds, which does not agree, and no API will settle it: a talent's
	-- effect lives in its tooltip text and parsing that is a worse dependency
	-- than this number. It is a seed for the first cast and nothing more, and
	-- the measurement replaces it the moment one is cast.

		cast = 1464, -- Slam, rank 1

	--
	-- Battle Shout, rank 1, and it is the one class ability on a row that is
	-- otherwise about things anybody standing in melee wants. Rank 1 covers all
	-- eight because the match is by name.
	--
	-- 6673 is Battle Shout rank 1: Wowhead's TBC database gives it as 10 rage,
	-- +15 attack power for 2 minutes, which is rank 1's own number. Rank 3 of
	-- the same spell, 6192, is in this install's Details saved variables off a
	-- live 2.5.6 session, so the ranked chain is real on this client.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-- The three specs
	--
	-- Tree order, which is the order the client counts them in and the order the
	-- resolver falls back on: 1 arms, 2 fury, 3 protection.
	--
	-- What is not written again inside them is the point of the shape. All three
	-- stand in the same three stances, cast the same three openers, open on the
	-- same dodge, wait on the same twenty percent, put the same Slam inside the
	-- same swing and want the same shout on the upkeep row. Those six fields are
	-- above and stay there. What a warrior spec actually disagrees about is which
	-- long cooldowns are worth counting, which short ones are worth a clock, and
	-- which debuffs are worth a square, and that is what each of these three says.
	--
	-- The bar plan is above as well, and deliberately. It pages by stance rather
	-- than by tree, every cell of it is a spell all three own, and it is the plan
	-- the warrior on this account presses. A per spec plan would be three copies
	-- of one table differing in two cells.
	--
	-- Arms carries no signature and does not need one. Death Wish and Last Stand
	-- are single rank talents at the foot of the other two trees, so a warrior who
	-- has neither and has spent points somewhere is named by their tree, and arms
	-- is what that answers. Mortal Strike would be the obvious signature and has
	-- six ranks, which is a rank table that goes stale at the next trainer visit.
	--
	-- The long ids: 12292 Death Wish, 1719 Recklessness, 871 Shield Wall, 12975
	-- Last Stand. All four are on Wowhead's TBC Classic database at those ids with
	-- the cooldowns the row draws, and all four are the same id on Era. None of
	-- the four was ever ranked.
	--
	-- What is deliberately not on any of the three. Retaliation is thirty minutes
	-- on these clients, which is not a fight cooldown, it is a wing cooldown.
	-- Bloodrage comes back inside a minute and is on the rotation layer instead,
	-- which is where a thing that is nearly always ready belongs.
