-- Switching target and swinging at it
--
-- TAB picks the next enemy and stops there. In a fight that costs a second
-- press, because the swing does not follow the target, and the mob you just
-- switched to stands there untouched until you notice. This is one key that
-- does both, in that order and inside one macro, so the attack lands on the
-- mob the cycle just picked rather than on whatever was targeted a moment
-- before.
--
-- It is a secure action button carrying a macro rather than Lua calling the
-- two functions, for the reason Charge/Icon.lua is one: starting an attack is
-- protected, and a macro run off a hardware key press is the path that is
-- allowed to do it. The macro is a constant, which the charge macro is not, so
-- nothing here is ever rewritten and combat can refuse only a rebind.
--
-- Bind it in /wk or with `/wk switch <key>`, or put
-- `/click WarriorKitSwitchButton` in a normal macro and drag that to a bar.

-- The two the binding system must never lose, refused here for the reason

-- targeting and the camera drag. The panel's key field refuses them too, so

-- /targetenemy is TAB's own binding, TARGETNEARESTENEMY, said as a macro
-- command, so this cycles exactly the way TAB does and honours the same
-- settings. /startattack carries harm and nodead because the cycle can land on
-- nothing at all when there is nothing in range to land on, and a bare
-- /startattack then answers back in chat for a key press that did nothing.
--
-- The conditional belongs on the attack line and nowhere else. A bare
-- [harm,nodead] tests the target you already have, not the one the cycle is
-- about to pick, so on /targetenemy it would decide whether the cycle runs at
-- all: your mob dies, the corpse fails nodead, and the key does nothing on the
-- one press it exists for. Nothing filters what TargetNearestEnemy picks, and
-- TAB skips corpses on its own anyway.

-- frame with no size cannot be. It is left shown, because a click delivered by
-- the binding system is only proven to arrive on a shown frame.
--
-- The press, because only the key ever fires it. It used to register the press
-- and leave the attribute unset, which worked only while the player kept the
-- client's key-down setting on.

-- make that permanent and lose whatever you had on the key. An override sits
-- on top of the set instead, so TAB stays TAB in your bindings file even while
-- this holds it.
--
-- That is also why this key is set here and not in Bindings.xml: a binding
