-- Floating messages
--
-- A message arrives from one side of the screen, holds where it landed, and
-- fades. Several at once form a column under the first, each entering a beat
-- after the one above it, and when the top one goes the rest climb into the
-- space it left.
--
-- **A lane, not a message.** The interesting part is never one message. One
-- message is a slide and a fade and would be four lines at the call site. What
-- costs a file is the second one arriving while the first is still travelling,
-- and the third landing after the first has gone. So the object here is the
-- column: it owns the order, the slots and the stagger, and a caller hands it a
-- finished frame and gets told when that frame is free again.
--
-- **The two offsets are measured against different things on purpose.** A
-- message comes in from an edge and rests near the middle, and those are two
-- different questions. `enterEdge` is how far inside the screen's edge it
-- starts, which is a fact about the edge it is coming from; `restCentre` is how
-- far short of the screen's centre it stops, which is a fact about where the
-- eye is. Expressing both against one anchor would mean the caller doing the
-- screen-width arithmetic, and doing it again on every resolution change. Both
-- are resolved here, at the moment a message is pushed, so a lane written once
-- is right on every monitor.
--
-- **They are also measured to different edges of the message, which is the part
-- that was wrong first.** A message is pinned by the corner nearest the side it
-- came from, so the entry offset is a distance to that corner and needs no
-- width. The rest offset is not: the eye reads the message by its far edge, and
-- a lane that stopped the near corner forty pixels short of the centre put two
-- hundred and twenty pixels of message across it. So the rest offset is
-- measured to the far edge and the width is taken off.
--
-- **Why the frames belong to the caller.** This file draws nothing. A loot row
-- is an icon, a name in the item's own colour and a count; an achievement is a
-- different shape and a warning is a third. A lane that built its own rows
-- would have to know all three, and the one thing it actually needs from a row
-- is how tall it is. So `Push` takes a frame and a height, and `onGone` hands
-- the frame back when the message has finished, which is where a caller pools
-- it.
--
-- The lane's own bookkeeping is pooled here for the same reason the tweens are:
-- a message that appears fifty times an evening must not be fifty tables for
-- the collector, because the reflow below runs from inside a tween's completion
-- and that is the tick path.
