--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Animation
--
-- Nothing in this addon moved before this file. Every part that looked like it
-- did was a bar being resized on a ticker: the cast fill, the swing timer, the
-- gauges. A resize on a tick is not an animation, it is a number being drawn,
-- and the difference shows up the moment something has to arrive somewhere it
-- was not, wait, and go.
--
-- **Why not the client's own animation groups.** CreateAnimationGroup is on
-- this client and it draws a translation more smoothly than a Lua tick can,
-- because it runs in C between frames. Three things it cannot do are the three
-- this is for. It animates a frame's position by offset and gives nothing back
-- that says where the frame currently is, so a second animation that has to
-- start from wherever the first one got to has to guess; a group's OnFinished
-- is a closure per group, which is an allocation per message; and a group is
-- built, not armed, so a row that appears twice a minute builds two groups a
-- minute for the collector to walk. A tween here is a table that is filled in
-- once and re-armed forever.
--
-- **What a tween is.** A frame, a duration, an easing, and up to two channels:
-- where it sits and how solid it is. Both channels are optional, so a tween
-- with neither is a timer, which is what a message resting on screen is, and
-- the wait is then the same object running through the same tick as the move
-- that preceded it rather than a second mechanism beside it.
--
-- **Why arming is four calls and not one table.** A table handed in per
-- animation is garbage per animation, and the reflow below runs from inside a
-- tween's own completion, which is on the tick path. So a tween is allocated
-- once by whoever owns the frame and re-armed with positional arguments after
-- that. Arm, then Path and Alpha for whichever channels this run wants, then
-- Start. Arm is what clears the previous run, so a tween that was a slide can
-- be re-armed as a fade with no fields left over.
--
-- Nothing here reads a setting, names a frame or knows what is being animated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The curves, as functions of the fraction of the run that has elapsed.
--
-- A named table rather than a number naming a curve, because the caller reads
-- better for it and because an easing is a field on the tween: the tick calls
-- `tween.ease(t)` and never asks which one it got.
local Ease = {}

	return t
end

-- Fast at first and slowing into place, which is what an object arriving from
-- off the edge of the screen does. This is the default for a reason: linear
-- entry reads as mechanical at any duration, and the eye is reading the last
-- fifth of the move as "did it land" rather than as travel.

	local u = 1 - t

-- Every tween currently being advanced. Appended to on Start, and taken off two
-- different ways, which is the part that was wrong.
--
-- Away from the tick a removal is a swap with the last entry: free, and there is
-- no order here for it to disturb, because every tween is advanced by the same
-- delta.
--
-- Under the tick it cannot be that, and a whole bag of loot is what found it. A
-- completion calls the owner's code, that code stops other tweens, and the list
-- the walk is indexing changes shape underneath it: a swap-remove below the
-- walk drops an entry it has already beaten back into its path, and a list that
-- shrinks past the walk's own bound leaves it reading a slot that is no longer
-- there. Eight drops in one second is enough, and what it reads as in the game
-- is `attempt to index local 'tween' (a nil value)` twice a pull.
--
-- So a removal under the tick writes `false` into the slot and the walk sweeps
-- the holes out once it is finished with the list. Nothing moves while it is
-- being walked, no tween is beaten twice, and no slot goes missing.
