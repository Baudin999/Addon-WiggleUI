--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- A column of headed rows, repainted rather than rebuilt
--
-- Three places in the character window are the same picture: a heading, some
-- rows under it, each row a name on the left and a value on the right, some of
-- them with a sentence underneath and some with a bar. The skills tab, the
-- reputation tab and the stats column down the right of the gear page differ in
-- what they put in that shape and in nothing else, so they hand this pane the
-- same table and it draws all three.
--
-- **The lines are a pool.** This client cannot destroy a frame, so a pane that
-- built its rows when it was handed a list would leak a frame for every skill
-- every time anything moved. There is one frame per line the pane has ever
-- needed, every region either kind of line can want is on all of them, and a
-- repaint shows the regions this line uses and hides the rest. It is the same
-- argument the quest window's two right-hand columns make.
--
-- **Nothing here is laid out by UI/Stack.lua**, which is the other thing in the
-- addon that puts rows in a column, and the reason is that a stack's cells are
-- added once and this list is handed a different number of rows every time it
-- is filled. A stack would need a way to forget its cells, which is a method
-- that exists for one caller and would then have to be right for the options
-- window as well. Placing the rows here costs eight lines.
--
-- A row measures itself the same way a stack cell does, and for the same
-- reason: the sentence under a weapon skill wraps, and how tall it wraps to is
-- not known until the pane has been given its width.
--
-- **Compact is a mode, and it is what the stats column is drawn in.** A row
-- there is one line and nothing else: the sentence that would have wrapped
-- under it goes into the hover, along with the value, so a number clipped by a
-- narrow column is still readable by pointing at it. Thirty-five rows of prose
-- is a page you scroll past rather than read, and the stats are a column you
-- glance at while you swap a ring. The two tabs that are a page in their own
-- right, skills and reputation, keep their sentences on the page.
--
-- **A compact row is banded, and the band is doing two jobs.** It is what tells
-- one line of numbers from the line under it once the air between them has been
-- taken away, which is the whole of what compact did to them. And it is the
-- only ground the column has: the character sheet it is drawn on is a backdrop
-- over the game world with no panel behind it, so a stat printed on nothing is
-- a stat you read against grass. Two tones alternating, both of them the
-- palette's own, both low enough that the world still shows through.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The bar under a row that has a fraction, and the air around it. Short,
-- because a row is a line of text and this is a mark beside it rather than a
-- gauge: five pixels says how far along you are without turning a list of
-- thirty skills into thirty progress bars stacked up the window.
local BAR = 5

-- How much of the row's width the value on the right may take before the name
-- on the left starts being clipped. Values here are short, "300 of 300" and
-- "Honored, 5400 of 12000" being the two longest shapes, and the name is what
-- you are reading down the column, so the split favours the name.
local VALUE = 150

-- The same split in a compact row, and it is measured rather than chosen: the
-- longest value the stats column ever prints is "3.60 seconds", and this is
-- that with a few pixels to spare. The value is pinned to the right edge, so
-- every pixel reserved here beyond what the number uses is white space between
-- a name and the number it belongs to. Anything that still does not fit is in
-- the hover, which is the whole bargain compact makes.
local TIGHT = 96

-- How tall a compact row is. Two over the font it draws, which is one pixel of
-- leading above the line and one below: the least air that still reads as
-- separate rows rather than a block. A control row is twenty because you aim a
-- mouse at it; nothing here is clicked, so none of that height is earned. At
-- thirty-odd rows the six pixels saved on each are two hundred of scrolling.
