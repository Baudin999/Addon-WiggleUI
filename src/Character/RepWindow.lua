-- Where the standings went
--
-- Reputation was a tab on the character sheet, and it was there because the
-- client keeps it on the window this addon takes away rather than because it
-- belongs beside your gear. Nothing on this list moves when you swap a ring.
-- When the sheet folded down to one page the standings could not follow the
-- skills into the stats column, because a faction is not a number about your
-- character, so they got a window instead and `/wui reputation` opens it.
--
-- Character/Reputation.lua did not change. It hands back a title and a list of
-- rows exactly as it did as a tab, this window hosts the same ns.CharReadout
-- pane the tab was, and the page draws the same.
--
-- **Built on the first open**, which is what every window in the addon does
-- except the sheet this one came off. The sheet cannot: its key press runs a
-- snippet, a snippet may only touch a frame it has been handed a reference to,
-- and neither can be made in a fight. Nothing here is secure, nothing here is
-- bound to a key, and a list of factions is not something anybody needs mid
-- pull, so a player who never types the word pays for none of it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The width of a column of prose, and it is the one number the old tab kept
-- when the sheet became the screen. A faction with a bar beside it is read at a
-- column's width however much room there is: laid across an ultrawide it is a
-- line your eye loses on the way back. This is the content width of the window
-- the tab was drawn in before any of that changed.
local WIDTH = 836

-- Tall enough for a dozen rows and their headings without scrolling, which is
-- about what a character carries before Outland. Past that the pane's own view
-- scrolls, so this is where the window opens rather than a limit on the list.
