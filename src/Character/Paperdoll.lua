--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The gear page
--
-- Nineteen slots in two columns, the player standing full height in the gap
-- between them, and against the right edge who you are, what your gear adds up
-- to and every number the client knows about you.
--
-- **This page is the screen, not a page in a window.** The sheet it is drawn on
-- has no title bar, no border, no ground and no saved point: it is the size of
-- the monitor, fixed to it, and sits at the floor of the frame pile so
-- everything the player opens flows over the top. UI/Window.lua carries that as
-- `screen`, and its own comment says why each piece of chrome came off. What it
-- costs this file is that nothing here may assume a surface behind it. Every
-- string takes the rim rather than the flat face, and the only ground on the
-- page is the band under a stat row, which is a tint rather than a panel.
--
-- **The width is whatever the monitor is.** There is no fixed page any more, so
-- the two columns and the readings take the room they need and the figure gets
-- the rest, which on any screen worth playing on is most of it. That is the one
-- number this layout is built on: a column is as wide as an item's name wants
-- to be, and the middle is everything left over.
--
-- **The stats and the skills are the right hand column.** Both were pages of
-- their own, which meant the two halves of one question lived in two places:
-- the squares say what you are wearing and the numbers say what wearing it
-- does, and swapping a ring to see the second one move was a page away from the
-- first. The skills went the same way and for a sharper version of the same
-- reason: the miss badge at the head of this column is computed from your
-- weapon skill. So the readout is a column down the right of this page, filled
-- from Character/Stats.lua, Character/Skills.lua and Character/Reputation.lua
-- and drawn by the same Character/Readout.lua that drew all three pages.
--
-- **That column has four tabs on it, and they are not the window's old ones
-- back.** The window's tabs took the gear off the screen to show you a number;
-- these leave the gear, the figure and the four readings exactly where they are
-- and change one list. What they buy is that the column was forty rows deep
-- once, and the four things in it are read at four different rates: your hit
-- and attributes while you swap a ring, the rating groups while you work out a
-- set, your languages twice a year. TABS below says which is which. Which tab
-- is up is saved per character.
--
-- **The four readings are badges at the head of that column, over your name.**
-- They were four cells along the foot of the portrait, drawn on a band of
-- shadow laid over the model, and both of those went with the panel: a band of
-- shadow across a figure standing on the world is a smear, and the numbers
-- belong with the other numbers rather than on the picture. Each is a disc with
-- the value in it and the word under it, in the same order every time, so after
-- a week you read the second badge rather than the word durability. The
-- sentence each of them is worth is still in its hover and the window's own
-- footer still says all four in a line.
--
-- **The figure is yours to turn.** Left drag turns him, the wheel walks him
-- nearer and further, and a mark in his bottom corner puts his weapons in his
-- hands. All three are remembered per character, so the sheet opens the way you
-- left it, and the two the wheel drives stop at both ends: the page is half a
-- monitor with no reset on it, and a figure wound out of that half is a bug the
-- player can only undo by winding the wheel back. The right button is the
-- camera's throughout, by the rule the rows keep.
--
-- **A square carries the durability of what is in it.** One line along the
-- bottom edge, drawn only where the piece is worn at all, green through to red.
-- Durability is the one fact about your gear that changes while you play and
-- the one the client hides behind a hover, and a repair bill you can see coming
-- is a repair bill that never surprises you in a doorway.
--
-- **A square is a secure button, and it has to be.** The client's own sheet
-- answers a left click with the cursor swap and a right click with the use call
-- that takes a piece off or fires it. Only half of that is open to an addon:
-- the swap is an ordinary call, and using what is in a slot is protected. A
-- page that called it got the dialog saying WiggleUI has been blocked from an
-- action only available to the Blizzard UI, and so did a page that tried to
-- finish a spell the client was holding until it was told which item it was
-- for. That is a sharpening stone, an oil, an enchanting scroll or a poison,
-- and it is the bug that put this square on a secure template.
--
-- So the right button carries `/use <slot>` as a macro, written once at build,
-- and the client runs it on the path a macro runs on. The left button is left
-- alone: `target-slot` is the secure template's own answer to "a spell is
-- waiting for an item and this button is about to be clicked", and it uses the
-- slot after any click that finds one waiting. Nothing is armed, so nothing has
-- to be disarmed and nothing has to stand down in a fight. A left click with
-- nothing waiting reaches PostClick and is still the swap.
--
-- **The edge is named.** Registered for the release and acting on the press,
-- the square drew, hovered and did nothing at all, which is the same bug the
-- action bars shipped once already. UI/Press.lua builds it now, and that file
-- is where the rule is written down.
--
-- **The action is the size of the icon, and the rest of the row is the
-- camera's.** A square whose right click is an action cannot also pass the
-- right button through: it would draw and hover perfectly while its right click
-- went to the camera and nowhere else. That is a fair price on thirty-six
-- pixels and a bad one on a row two hundred wide, and this page is the whole
-- monitor now, so two columns of full width buttons is most of the left and
-- right of the screen with no camera in it. So the button is the disc, which is
-- where the client puts a slot's button and where a bag puts an item's, and the
-- row it sits on is an ordinary frame that takes the mouse for the hover and
-- hands the camera back with UI.PassCamera.
--
-- What that costs: a left click, a drag out and a drop in all want the icon
-- rather than the item's name beside it. That is what every other item in the
-- game already wants.
--
-- **Nineteen secure buttons are what closed this window in a fight, and the key
-- is what opened it again.** A secure button is a protected frame, showing a
-- window that has a protected frame inside it is itself protected, and an addon
-- may not do a protected thing in combat. So the sheet would not come up mid
-- pull, which is when the durability line is worth most. The answer was not to
-- give the squares up: Character/Window.lua has the key press run a snippet, a
-- snippet is allowed to show the window in combat, and the page underneath is
-- never hidden by a tab change. Nothing on this page changed for it.
--
-- **A click asks the slot about the fight, not the fight.** Armour cannot be
-- changed in combat and a weapon can, which is the client's own rule and the
-- one Blizzard's sheet plays by, so Character/Worn.lua answers per slot and the
-- three hands stay live mid pull. A stone is refused by the same rule: using
-- what is in a slot is protected, the secure half is what runs it, and it does
-- not run in a fight.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The client draws its slots at thirty-six and this draws them at thirty-six,
-- for the reason UI/Widgets.lua borrows the client's slot ring: a square you
-- drag a helmet into should be the size of the square the helmet came out of.
local SQUARE = 36
local WEAR = 2

-- How far inside the ring the icon sits, which is also how wide the band of
-- quality colour showing round it is.
local RIM = 3

-- The socket discs. Three because three is the most holes anything in this
-- expansion has, and that has not changed.
--
-- Twelve pixels and not five. Five was the width of a mark that says a socket
-- is there, and a mark is all it could be while the disc was flat colour. It
-- carries the gem's own icon now, and a gem icon at five pixels is four
-- coloured dots and a rounding error. At twelve it is a picture you can name
-- across a row, and it is still shorter than the name above it.
local DOTS = 3
local DOT = 12

-- How much of the disc the ring round the gem keeps for itself, which is the
-- same bargain RIM strikes on the thirty-six pixel face and cannot be the same
-- number: three of twelve is a quarter of the disc gone to its own edge. Two
-- leaves a band of colour all the way round and eight pixels of gem inside it.
local BAND = 2

-- How far apart two rows in a column sit.
local GAP = 4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The line under a name
--
-- It said the item level and nothing else. On a character at the level cap
-- every piece is enchanted, and the sheet is where you go to find out which one
-- you forgot: an unenchanted pair of boots is invisible on the figure, absent
-- from every number on the page, and worth as much as the difference between
-- two tiers of the same slot.
--
-- So the line carries three things now and they read near end first: the item
-- level, how long is left on the stone or the oil, and what is enchanted on it.
--
-- **The order mirrors with the column.** The right hand rows are justified to
-- their own disc, so the string ends at the disc rather than starting there,
-- and printing the three in the same order on both sides would put the level
-- against the disc on the left and against the middle of the page on the right.
-- Narcissus swaps the pair at Main.lua:1621 for the same reason on the same
-- line, and what it buys is that the number you scan a column for is always the
-- one nearest the picture.
--
-- **The enchant is the half that gives way.** Something long, like the name of
-- a two hander's spell damage enchant, is at the far end in both columns, where
-- a row that is too narrow for it clips it. The level and the time are short
-- and never lose a digit.
--
-- The two spaces are the gap between them. A separator would be a third thing
-- on a line that already carries three, and the strings are three different
-- colours already.
local SPACE = "  "

-- A palette entry as the escape the client colours part of a string with.
--
-- One string of three, so the escapes rather than three font strings. Three
-- strings would each need an anchor to the end of the one before it, which is a
-- width nothing knows until the repaint has set the text, and the wash under
-- the row is measured off the note's own width: it would have to add three of
-- them up and get the gaps right as well. The client already colours a run
-- inside a font string and counts none of it in GetStringWidth.
local function Ink(color)
	return ("|cff%02x%02x%02x"):format(
		math.floor(color[1] * 255), math.floor(color[2] * 255), math.floor(color[3] * 255))
end

-- Green for the enchant, because green is what the client's own tooltip writes
-- that line in and the page is not going to teach a second colour for it. The
-- level and a healthy time keep the note's own dim, so the enchant is the only
-- thing on the line that asks to be read.
local ENCHANT_INK = Ink(C.tick)

-- And red once there is not enough left to be worth planning around. A stone
-- runs an hour, so five minutes is the point where the answer stops being "it
-- is fine" and starts being "do it before the pull".
local LAPSING_INK = Ink(C.loss)
local LAPSING = 5

-- How often the time left is looked at again, and it is the smallest useful
-- number rather than the cheapest.
--
-- The line counts in whole minutes for an hour and in whole seconds for the
-- last one, so a tick slower than a second would show a stale figure through
-- the part of the countdown anybody is watching. What it costs is one pass over
-- three rows a second while the sheet is open, and the write behind it happens
-- fifty nine times an hour rather than once a second.
local LAPSE = 1

-- The wash under a row's two strings: how much taller it is than the pair of
-- them, and how much wider than the longer of them.
--
-- Eighteen is a line of air over the name and the same under the item level,
-- which is what stops the shadow reading as an underline. Forty-eight is the
-- disc and its gutter at the near end, where the wash is solid, plus what is
-- left over at the far end, where it has already faded to nothing.
--
-- Forty-eight is also why nothing clamps the total to the row. The name is
-- measured clamped to the room it had, which is the row less the disc and the
-- gutter, so the widest this can come out is the row plus twelve less that
-- gutter of eight: four pixels, at the transparent end.
local WASH_TALL = 18
local WASH_WIDE = 48

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The page is the size of what is on it
--
-- It was a share of the monitor twice, and both times the page was the wrong
-- size on somebody's screen. First it was the whole panel, which put the name
-- of your helmet a third of a monitor from the helmet. Then it was half the
-- monitor's width at four by three, which is 960 by 720 on a 1080p panel and
-- 1720 by 1290 on a 3440 wide one. The rows did not grow with it. Ten squares
-- and nine gaps are 396 pixels tall on every monitor there is, so on the
-- ultrawide the gear stood in the middle of the page with four hundred and
-- fifty pixels of nothing over it and the same again underneath, and the
-- figure floated in the hole between the columns with his head and his feet a
-- long way from either edge.
--
-- So the page asks for its own size instead, and Natural below is the whole of
-- the question. Ten rows of gear is the height. The three columns at the width
-- each is worth having, with the figure standing in what a person's build asks
-- for at that height, is the width. UI/Window.lua still says the sheet may
-- never take more than half the monitor and never more than the monitor is
-- tall, and on a small enough screen that ceiling is what binds; on any screen
-- larger than the page, the page wins and the rest of the monitor is left to
-- play on.
--
-- What that costs is the stats column, which is the one thing on the page
-- taller than ten rows of gear. It has scrolled since it was folded out of the
-- tabs and it scrolls further now. That is the trade: the sheet is a panel you
-- read at a glance with one column you run down, rather than a panel two
-- thirds empty with one column that happens to fit.
--
-- The widths are bounded at both ends, because a share of a page is not a share
-- of a name. A column has to hold "Bloodfang Spaulders of the Underworld" and
-- there is no point in it holding twice that, so the ceiling is the longest
-- name the game has and the floor is a disc with enough of a name beside it to
-- be worth printing. The ceiling is what the page is built at and the floor is
-- what a screen too small for it falls back to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- How wide the frame around the figure has to be for the page's height to be
-- his whole height.
--
-- The client scales a model to the width of the frame holding it, so the width
-- is what decides how big the figure comes out and the height is only whether
-- there is room for all of him. A landscape frame is therefore a giant cropped
-- at the crown and the knees, which is what filling the page with him produced.
--
-- BUILD is narrower than a person is, deliberately. A standing humanoid is
-- about one wide to two tall, so a frame at that ratio is a figure that exactly
-- fills it and crops on the first tabard that hangs low or headdress that
-- stands up. At forty-six hundredths he draws to about eleven twelfths of the
-- frame and the twelfth left over is the air over his crown and under his
-- heels.
--
-- There was a FIGURE beside this, eight tenths, saying how much of the page's
-- height he stood in. The other two tenths were the air a page taller than its
-- own contents had to put somewhere, and the page is not taller than its
-- contents any more. The room over his head is BUILD's now, which is where it
-- was always being decided.
local BUILD = 0.46

-- One column of rows: the disc, a gutter and the name.
local COLUMN_MIN, COLUMN_MAX = 130, 280

-- The stats column. Read as the row added up: a scroll bar, the widest name the
-- page prints beside a number, the gutter, and the room the value is pinned
-- into.
local READING_MIN, READING_MAX = 165, 320

-- The narrowest the figure is ever squeezed to. Under this the page is not a
-- character sheet, it is two lists with a keyhole between them, and the two
-- columns are what give way.
local STAGE_MIN = 150

-- The margin between the gear block and the page's own edge, one each side.
-- Not padding for its own sake: the page's width is a sum of five things that
-- are each rounded to a whole pixel, and without a couple of units of slack the
-- rounding lands on the first disc and shaves it.
local EDGE = 8

-- The air over the top of the rows and under the bottom of them.
--
-- The page was the gear and nothing else for about ten minutes, and a page that
-- is exactly its contents is a page with no contents to spare. The top row sat
-- on the edge, the bottom row sat on the footer rule, and the figure had only
-- the twelfth BUILD keeps him for his own crown, which is sixteen pixels and
-- less than a troll's headdress.
--
-- Both ends and not just the top, which is what makes the rows come out centred
-- in Resize without a case of their own. A column pinned thirty units down and
-- flush at the bottom is a column that looks like it slipped.
local CROWN = 30

-- A share of a number, held between the two widths it is worth having.
--
-- The fraction is not a constant any more. Every column's share is its own best
-- width over the page's best width, which Resize works out from Natural, so a
-- page squeezed under the size it asked for squeezes every column on it by the
-- same factor and a page at its own size gives every column exactly what it
-- asked for. Two hand-picked fractions used to say that and only said it at one
-- width.
local function Share(room, fraction, least, most)
	return math.max(math.min(math.floor(room * fraction), most), least)
end

-- The head of that column, top to bottom: your name, the line under it saying
-- what you are, the air before the badges, the badges themselves and the word
-- under each one.
local NAME = M.heading + 5
local BADGE = 44
local BADGERIM = 2
local HEAD = NAME + 2 + M.small + M.gutter + BADGE + 2 + M.small

-- The number inside a disc, and it is the only string in the addon smaller than
-- M.small.
--
-- It was M.font, which is what every other number on the page is set in, and it
-- did not fit. The disc is forty-four across and the string is pinned two
-- inside each edge of it, so a reading has forty units to live in. Three of the
-- four are short: "80.2", "100%" and a single digit. The fourth is "9.00%",
-- which is four figures, a point and a per cent sign, and a per cent sign is
-- the widest glyph in the face at any size. At twelve that came to forty-four
-- units and painted itself onto the rim on both sides.
--
-- Ten rather than eleven because eleven is forty units on the nose, and a
-- reading that exactly fills the room it has is a reading that clips on the
-- first character who rolls a miss chance over ten per cent. At ten the longest
-- of the four has two units of air each side and the other three have far more.
local BADGEFONT = M.small - 1

-- The mark in the corner of the figure. Wide enough for the longer of its two
-- words at eleven pixels and no wider, because it stands on the figure and
-- every pixel of it is a pixel of him.
local SHEATHE = 52

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The pose
--
-- Three numbers: which way he is facing, how near he stands, and whether his
-- weapons are in his hands. They live in this character's own saved variables
-- and Character/Feature.lua declares them, because a pose is not an account
-- wide preference: the angle that reads on a tauren warrior is not the angle
-- that reads on a gnome, and one number serving both is one of them wrong.
--
-- 0.010 radians to the pixel is Blizzard's own MODELFRAME_DRAG_ROTATION_CONSTANT
-- out of the FrameXML this client ships. Matching it means a drag on this figure
-- and a drag in the client's own dressing room move the same amount, which is
-- the whole of what a player has already learnt about turning a model.
local TURN = 0.010
local TWOPI = math.pi * 2

-- One notch of the wheel, and the two calls the number it writes turns into.
--
-- `near` runs from nothing to one and stops dead at both ends. The sheet is
-- half the screen and there is no reset on the page, so a figure wound past
-- either end is a camera inside his chest or a dot in the middle of a page,
-- and neither is undone by anything except winding the wheel back.
--
-- Both calls, because one on its own does the wrong thing. SetCamDistanceScale
-- brings the camera in on the model's own origin, which on a character is
-- between his feet, so half distance on its own is a close look at a pair of
-- boots. SetPosition moves the model, and positive z is up: Blizzard's own pan
-- in ModelFrames.lua adds the cursor's rise to z and the figure follows it
-- upward. So he sinks by as much as the camera comes in, and what fills the
-- panel at the near end is a man rather than the ground he is standing on.
local STEP = 0.1
local CLOSEST = 0.5
local SINK = -0.35

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The wait on a slot you press
--
-- Two trinkets, an engineering helm and a weapon with a use on it, and the
-- sheet is where a player looks to see whether the trinket they are about to
-- pull with is off cooldown. The client answers per slot through
-- ns.InventoryCooldown, which was written, probed and called by nothing on this
-- page.
--
-- Drawn on the ring the disc already has rather than as a swipe over the icon.
-- A Cooldown frame draws a square wedge and every square on this page is round,
-- so the swipe would hang out past the disc at four corners; UI.Arc cuts the
-- same wedge out of the same circle the ring is, and its own head says how.
--
-- Only a slot holding something you press. A passive trinket with a proc on it
-- carries a cooldown too, and a dark ring on a trinket you cannot spend is the
-- page saying wait about nothing. ns.ItemSpell is the call that tells them
-- apart and Core.lua argues it where it is written.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What the arc is drawn in. The theme's own sunken, opaque, because the whole
-- read is the difference between a ring that is its item's colour and a ring
-- that is not: at half strength both states are the quality colour and the
-- player is comparing two shades of purple across a column.
local COOL = C.sunken

-- How often it is redrawn, and the number is the shortest wait worth an arc.
-- Thirty seconds on a weapon moves the boundary about four pixels a second
-- round a thirty-six pixel disc, so a quarter second is a pixel of movement and
-- anything finer is a write UI.Sweep throws away. On a two minute trinket three
-- passes in four already do nothing.
local SWEEP = 0.25

-- The shortest wait that belongs to the item. A slot answers the global
-- cooldown as well as its own, so a trinket you have just pressed an ability
-- over reads a second and a half, and nineteen rings blinking on every
-- Bloodthirst says nothing about any trinket. Cooldowns/Cooldowns.lua draws the
-- line in the same place.
local OWN = 1.5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The two motions
--
-- Nothing on this page moved. Put a ring on and the word under the disc is a
-- different word between two frames, which you see only if you happened to be
-- looking at that row; open the sheet and nineteen rows and a figure are all
-- there at once, with nowhere for the eye to start.
--
-- Narcissus answers both and answers them apart, which is the half worth
-- taking. A slot whose item changed fades its string out over two tenths, sets
-- the new text on the animation's finish and fades that in, at
-- Main.lua:1727-1745. A slot arriving with the page comes in from its own side
-- of the screen, which is the `animOut` group on NarciSlotButtonLeftTemplate:
-- a hundred and twenty pixels over six tenths.
--
-- So two motions on the two channels of Ck/Animations.lua and no third. That
-- file's header says why the client's own animation groups were refused and
-- every reason holds here: nineteen rows would be nineteen groups built rather
-- than nineteen tweens armed, each carrying a closure for its own finish, and
-- a group gives nothing back that says where the frame it moved has got to.
--
-- **The fade is a dip and not two runs.** Narcissus can write the new string
-- on the finish because the string is its own to hold back. Here the repaint
-- has already written the row by the time anything can be armed, and holding
-- the text back for a fifth of a second would be a page whose words are behind
-- every caller that reads them. So the curve goes down and comes back up: one
-- tween armed once, nothing on the tick path to call, and the trough is the
-- moment Narcissus does its swap.
--
-- **The whole row dips rather than three regions of it.** The name, the line
-- under it and the icon are what changed, and so did the sockets, the
-- durability rule and the shadow the two strings are read on, because all six
-- describe the piece that moved. Half a row fading reads as broken rather than
-- as changed, and one tween a row is cheaper than three. The secure button is
-- not a child of the row and takes none of it.
--
-- **Both are refused in a fight, and nothing here is protected.** The sheet is
-- opened mid pull to be read: what is left on the weapon, what is about to
-- break, what the badges at the head of the column say. Nineteen rows sliding
-- in over six tenths of a second is nineteen rows you cannot read while they
-- do it, and a row dipping to nothing is the one you were reading going away.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

local Animations = ns.Ck.Animations

-- Down and back up as one curve.
--
-- The alpha channel is armed from one to nought and multiplies this, so nought
-- at both ends of the run is a row at full strength at both ends of the fade.
-- Straight lines rather than a rounded trough: the trough is one frame out of
-- four tenths of a second and a curve through it is arithmetic nobody sees.
local function Dip(t)
	return 1 - math.abs(1 - 2 * t)

-- Two tenths down and two tenths back, which is Narcissus's own fade twice.
local FADE = 0.4

-- How far a row travels to arrive, how long it is travelling, and how much
-- later each row down a column starts than the one above it.
--
-- The lead is the whole difference between a sweep and a block. Ten rows at
-- three hundredths is three tenths between the top of a column and its foot
-- against six tenths of travel, so a column is always moving as a whole and
-- never lands as a line.
--
-- The travel is further than the page has margin, and deliberately: a row starts
-- outside the sheet and comes in from under its edge, which is what "in from its
-- own side" means and what the eye reads as a slide. Twenty units of travel is a
-- twitch. It only works because Paperdoll.New clips the page, and the day that
-- clip is dropped this number is what draws nineteen squares over the world.

local Pane = {}
Pane.__index = Pane

-- The one gear page there is, so the two ticks that hang off ns.UI.Forever can

--
-- A file local rather than the frame a tick hangs off, which is how the turn

-- reaches its instance. Neither of the two below hangs off a frame at all:
-- three rows once a second and a disc or two four times a second are not worth
-- a frame each, and a tick on a frame of its own owes scripts/check.sh an entry
-- defending a frame that can hide. The visibility test at the top of Lapse and
-- of Sweep is what that entry would have said, written as one comparison a
-- tick.
--
-- Character/Window.lua builds exactly one of these and never takes it down,
-- because the page holds nineteen secure buttons and hiding one of those in a
-- fight is a protected act. A second page would be a second thing this pointed
-- at and the sheet has no way to grow one.
