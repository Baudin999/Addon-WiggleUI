--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What you are wearing
--
-- Nineteen slots, what is in each of them, how worn it is, and the two calls
-- that put something in or take it off. Every question the gear page asks is
-- answered here, and nothing here draws anything.
--
-- **This is not Core/Gear.lua and the two do not overlap.** Gear answers "what
-- in your bags will the client let into a hand", which is a question about
-- things you are not wearing, asked so the charge macro can name one in a
-- macro line.
-- This answers "what is on you right now", which is a question about the
-- eighteen slots that have nothing to do with a macro. They meet at slots 16
-- and 17 and disagree about nothing: Gear names the two by number and this file
-- names all nineteen by number, out of the same client constants.
--
-- **Equipping goes through the cursor, the way the client's own sheet does.**
-- There is a call that equips an item by name and it is the wrong one here.
-- The right one is `PickupInventoryItem`, which swaps whatever is on the cursor
-- into the slot and picks up what was there, because that is the call
-- FrameXML's own paperdoll button makes and it is therefore the call the client
-- is written to accept from a hardware click. It costs nothing to be the same
-- as the thing being replaced.
--
-- It is refused in a fight, by the client rather than by this file, and the
-- refusal is silent. So the fight is checked here and the reason is said out
-- loud: a slot that does nothing when you click it is the worst version of this
-- page.
--
-- **Using what is in a slot is not a call at all, and that is the correction
-- this file exists in its current shape for.** `UseInventoryItem` is protected.
-- An addon that calls it from its own click gets the dialog saying WiggleUI
-- has been blocked from an action only available to the Blizzard UI, and so
-- does an addon that finishes a spell the client is holding until it is told
-- which item it is for, which is what a sharpening stone, a weapon oil, an
-- enchanting scroll and a poison all are. The client's own sheet may make that
-- call because it is the client's own sheet. This one may not, whatever it
-- calls, so it does not call: Character/Paperdoll.lua puts `/use <slot>` and a
-- `target-slot` on a secure button and the client runs both on the path a macro
-- runs on, which is the same `/use 16` every stone macro in the game already
-- carries. All this file owes that arrangement is the question below.
--
-- **Nothing is cached.** What you are wearing changes on an event the client
-- fires, the window redraws on that event, and a cache between the two would be
-- one more thing that can be stale while the picture says otherwise. The one
-- thing kept is the empty-slot art, which is a texture path the client answers
-- the same way for the life of the session.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The nineteen, in the order the page draws them: ten down the left and nine
-- down the right, with the figure standing in the gap between the two.
--
--   slot   the inventory number, which is what every call below takes
--   key    the client's own name for the slot, which is how the empty art is
--          asked for rather than written down as a texture path
--   label  what this addon calls it, lower case like every other label here
--   side   which of the two columns it is drawn in
--   hand   a slot a temporary enchant can be on, which is the three weapons and
--          nothing else. Marked here rather than counted at the call site,
--          because "which rows are weapons" is a fact about the slots and the
--          page already reads its rows out of this table
--
-- There were three groups and the third was the weapons, drawn as three bare
-- discs centred under the figure with no words on them at all. That was the one
-- place left on the page where you could not read what you were holding, and it
-- was a shape the sheets this page is drawn against do not have: they put the
-- weapons at the foot of the first column, in the same row shape as everything
-- else. So do these. Nothing was gained by the middle group except three
-- nameless circles and a durability chord that had to be drawn a special way
-- because there was no name to underline.
--
-- Shirt and tabard are last in their columns and are left out of the two
-- summaries the page draws on purpose: neither has an item level, neither wears
-- out, and counting them would drag both numbers down for wearing a guild
-- tabard. Last rather than sixth and seventh, which is where they were, because
-- a piece that counts for nothing belongs under the pieces that do.
