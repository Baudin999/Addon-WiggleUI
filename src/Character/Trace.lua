-- Off, and worth nothing until it is on. `/wk character trace` turns it on and
-- every click on a square then says what the client was asked and what it
-- answered, in chat, in the order it happened.
--
-- **It exists because the square has been wrong three times and each time the
-- symptom was the same word: nothing.** A click that never reached the button,
-- a click that reached it and acted on the other edge, and a click that acted
-- and was refused all look identical from a chair. The three are told apart by
-- what appears here: no line at all means the click never arrived, a press line
-- with no release line means an error in between, and a BLOCKED line names the
-- call the client refused and which addon it blamed.
--
-- **Nothing here is allowed to break a click.** Every client call goes through
-- the pcall below, every line is built from what came back rather than assumed,
-- and the whole file is a no-op while it is off, because a trace that errors in
-- PreClick would take the square down with it and that is the thing being
-- diagnosed.
