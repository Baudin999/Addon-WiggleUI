-- The character window
--
-- One page: what you are wearing, what it adds up to, and what you are skilled
-- at, all of it on the screen at once.
--
-- **It replaces the client's sheet rather than sitting beside it.** The client
-- draws this as three separate windows wearing one frame, with a picture of your
-- back taking the largest area of the first one and the number everybody
-- actually wants, how often you miss, on none of them. Blizzard.lua puts that
-- frame in the attic and takes the C key, behind the one switch on the page
-- where every other Blizzard frame this addon replaces is switched.
--
-- **The window has no tabs.** It had four, and each one was a press between two
-- halves of the same question. The stats went first, into a column down the
-- right of the gear page, because what a stat answers is what the piece you just
-- put on did. The skills followed it into that column: a weapon skill under the
-- cap is the number the miss badge at the head of the column is computed from,
-- and the two had been on separate pages since the sheet was built. Reputation
-- went to a window of its own on /wui reputation, which Character/RepWindow.lua
-- still hosts. What is left here is one window with one pane in it, and
-- Character/Paperdoll.lua is that pane.
--
-- There is a strip of four words inside that column now and it is not this
-- window's tabs coming back. A window tab took the gear off the screen; a column
-- tab changes the list beside it and moves nothing else. Character/Paperdoll.lua
-- carries what the four are and why.
--
-- What taking the tabs off paid for is the top edge. With nothing drawn up
-- there the four badges moved into the room the tab row was using, and the grip
-- UI/Window.lua hands a screen window took the whole edge before it took the
-- whole window.
--
-- **This window opens in a fight, and everything below that says `secure` or
-- `InCombatLockdown` is there for that one sentence.** The gear page carries
-- nineteen secure buttons because using what is in a slot is protected, a frame
-- built from a secure template is protected, and every protected thing an addon
-- does in combat is refused: showing this window, hiding it, moving it, sizing
-- it. Blizzard's own sheet does all of that in a fight because Blizzard's code
-- is allowed to.
--
-- An addon is allowed to borrow the permission one way, which is to have the
-- press run a snippet. So there are three answers here and no fourth. The key
-- is bound to a secure button whose snippet shows and hides the window, and the
-- cross on the title bar is the same button in the corner. Everything that
-- would have to move a protected frame, the layout and the zoom, waits for the
-- end of the fight. The Lua way in still exists and still refuses in a
-- fight, and says which key does work.
--
-- **Nothing here is on a ticker.** Your gear changes when the server says it
-- did, which is six events, and every one of them ends in a repaint of the page.
-- A window nobody has open is not repainted at all, and neither is one nobody
-- has opened yet: Window.Paint refuses while the window is down and the window's
-- own OnShow is what pays the first one.
--
-- **The frames are built at login and that is deliberate.** Every other window
-- in the addon waits for the first open. This one cannot: the key press runs a
-- snippet, a snippet may only touch a frame it has been handed a reference to,
-- and neither the window nor the reference can be made in a fight. A sheet
-- built on first press would be a C key that does nothing the first time it is
-- pressed in a pull. What login no longer pays for is the paint and the model,
-- which is where nearly all of the cost was.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- There are no two numbers here any more.
--
-- This was 860 by 520, arrived at by adding up a padding, two columns of rows,
-- the gap the figure stood in, a gutter and the narrowest column the stats
-- would draw into. Every one of those additions was an argument about how
-- little the page could be given and still work.
--
-- Then it was the whole monitor, which is a page with your helmet's name a third
-- of a monitor from the helmet and nothing left for the player to click on.
-- Then it was half the monitor across at four by three, which is the same
-- mistake sized down: a page whose height comes from the player's hardware, over
-- contents whose height comes from ten squares the client draws at thirty-six
-- pixels. On a 3440 wide panel that put four hundred and fifty pixels of nothing
-- over the gear and the same again under it.
--
-- So the sheet asks the page how big it is worth drawing at and is made that
-- size, plus this window's padding and the line along its bottom. `screen` in
-- UI/Window.lua now means where it sits and what chrome it does without, and the
-- half-a-monitor number it used to be sized by is the ceiling it is clamped to
-- on a screen too small for the page. The zoom is still the player's and still
-- means what it always meant: turn it up and the type and the discs get bigger,
-- and the window grows with them, because the page asks for the same count of
-- units and each unit is worth more pixels.

	-- The rim rather than the flat face, because this line is printed along the
	-- bottom of the screen over whatever the player is standing on.

	UI.Wrap(footer, false)

-- Held to the end of a fight. Sizing the gear page sizes the frame nineteen
-- secure buttons hang off, which is the same protected act as showing it, and
-- a sheet laid out for the old screen only has a wide margin until then.
--
-- The resize is what re-reads the monitor. The page says how big it is worth
-- drawing at, this adds the window's own padding and its footer to that, and
-- UI/Window.lua hands back whatever of it the screen could give: the full
-- request on a monitor with room for it, half the width and the height less the
-- margin on one without. Taking the answer back rather than assuming it is how a
-- sheet built at one resolution is still the right size after a monitor swap or
-- a drag of the zoom slider.
function Window.Fit()
	-- Both, and not just the window: this is handed to UI/Window.lua as the
	-- rescale for a frame that exists from the moment the window does, and the
	-- page is built after it.

		-- UI/Window.lua carries the whole of what that means; what it means here
		-- is that no width and no height are passed at construction, because the
		-- page they would describe has not been built yet. Fit above is what
		-- sizes this window, and Build calls it once the page exists.
		--
		-- No title bar is no close box, and a window without one owes the player
		-- another way out. This one has two, and both were here before the cross
		-- was: Escape, through UISpecialFrames, and the key that opened it, which

		-- shuts the sheet in a fight as well as out of one.
		--
		-- No title bar is also nothing to grab, so UI/Window.lua hands a screen
		-- window a grip instead, and the grip is the background: anywhere on the
		-- sheet the page has not put something starts a drag. Nothing is drawn to
