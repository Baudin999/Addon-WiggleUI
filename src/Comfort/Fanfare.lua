local ADDON, ns = ...

-- The fanfare when you level.
--
-- Five seconds of "You're the Best" over the client's own ding, and the whole
-- of what this part does. It is not a convenience the way the four chores above
-- it are: nothing here saves you a keypress and the addon is no better at
-- anything for having it. It is here because a level is the one moment in this
-- game that is entirely yours, the client marks it with a chime you stopped
-- hearing at about level twelve, and a horn section does not go unheard.
--
-- The sound is not in this addon and never travels with it. It is five seconds
-- of a record somebody else made, and this repository is public, so the one
-- thing here that was not ours to give away is the one thing that does not
-- ship. What ships is the path, the event and the switch.
--
-- So the file is yours to put there. Anything the client can read under that
-- name plays, and the joke everybody means is BestAround's own copy:
-- LittleJoey's addon from 2007, fixed for 6.0 by Nephyrin, four files and one
-- of them the song. Install that addon and the file is already on your disk.
-- Without it this part is silent and says so in `/wui`, which is the behaviour
-- it already had for a client that would not play sound at all.
--
-- This part owns no frame past the one it listens on and draws nothing, so
-- nothing here is on a ticker.

local Fanfare = {}
ns.Fanfare = Fanfare

-- The file, and the only line in the addon that names it. Nothing is shipped at
-- this path; see above. The client's paths are Interface\AddOns\<folder>\...,
-- with the folder being what the addon is installed as rather than what the TOC
-- calls itself, which is why this is written out rather than built from ADDON.
local SOUND = "Interface\\AddOns\\WiggleUI\\Media\\BestAround.mp3"

-- Master rather than the SFX channel the call defaults to.
--
-- SFX is where a spell landing and a sword hitting go, and it is the slider
-- people pull down to nothing in a raid. A level up happens about forty times
-- in a character's life and it is not a combat noise; putting it on the master
-- volume means the one person who turned their sound effects off still gets it,
-- and the one who turned everything off still does not.
local CHANNEL = "Master"

-- How long the clip runs, in seconds, measured off the file itself.
--
-- It is a throttle and not a timer: nothing is scheduled and nothing is
-- stopped. A quest turned in at the right moment levels you twice, the client
-- fires PLAYER_LEVEL_UP once per level, and two copies of the same five seconds
-- a frame apart is not a fanfare, it is a fault.
local CLIP = 5.1

local frame

-- When the clip last started, on the client's own clock, and how many times it
-- has since login. The count is the only thing the panel and the slash word
-- have to report, and it is a count rather than a list for the reason the
-- thank-you count is: what levels you took tonight is nobody's business but
-- yours.
local playedAt = 0
local plays = 0

-- Why the last attempt did not play, or nil if it did. Kept because all three
-- of the ways this can fail are silent by nature: a muted channel, a client
-- that will not take the call, and a file that is not where the path says. A
-- fanfare that does not sound and does not say why is indistinguishable from a
-- setting somebody forgot they turned off.
local lastWhy

-- One attempt, and how much the client said about it.
--
-- select("#") rather than three plain names, because "answered nil" and "said
-- nothing at all" are different answers and only the first of them is a muted
-- channel. Modern builds hand back willPlay and a handle; the two this addon
-- ships for are not proven to hand back anything, and reading a return that was
-- never made as a refusal would report every fanfare that played fine as one
-- that did not. Buffs/Upkeep.lua counts its returns for the same reason.
local function Speak(...)
	return select("#", ...), ...
end

-- Play it now, whatever the setting says, and answer what happened.
--
-- The setting is the caller's business: OnEvent is only registered while it is
-- on, and `/wui ding` is a press, which is the one thing in this addon that is
-- allowed to ignore a switch because you just asked for it by name.
