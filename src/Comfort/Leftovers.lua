-- Destroying what the loot filter refused.
--
-- The filter leaves what you did not ask for on the corpse, which is the point
-- of it and is the wrong answer for one person: a corpse only opens for a
-- skinner once every slot is gone. So this is the switch for the person who
-- skins. With it on, a slot the filter refused is looted anyway and the item is
-- destroyed the moment it lands in a bag.
--
-- It ships off, and Feature.lua says why beside the default. This is the second
-- thing in the addon that destroys what you own and the first that does it
-- without a window in front of you, so the guards matter more here than in the
-- clutter window, where at least somebody is looking.
--
-- **Never a blue.** Quality three and up is left on the corpse whatever the
-- switch says, and so is a slot whose quality this client will not state. An
-- addon deleting an epic behind somebody's back is not a thing a tick box can
-- ask for, because the one time it happens is the time nobody can undo it. A
-- quest item is left for the same reason read from the other end: the quest is
-- why you are standing over the corpse.
--
-- **The count, not the slot.** Loot lands in a stack you already had, so the
-- slot the item arrived in is not the item that arrived. Twelve cloth in a bag
-- and two off a corpse is one stack of fourteen, and destroying that slot
-- destroys the twelve you walked in with. What is remembered is how many
-- arrived, and what is destroyed is that many split off the stack.
--
-- **A pending item is forgotten after five seconds.** A LootSlot the server
-- refused, because the bags were full or because somebody rolled faster, is an
-- item that never arrives. An entry left waiting on it would destroy the next
-- one of those you picked up an hour later, which is the worst thing this file
-- could do and the only one that would look like a haunting rather than a bug.
-- Five seconds is long enough for a server to answer and short enough that
-- nothing else can be mistaken for the answer.
--
-- This part owns no frame anybody can see and draws nothing, so nothing here is
-- on a ticker.
--
-- **The loot feed destroys through here too.** The cross and the can on a feed
-- row, and every drop of an item on the feed's delete list, owe a count the way
-- a corpse slot does and are paid by the same walk under the same refusals. One
-- path that splits a stack and deletes the cursor is one path to get right.
