-- Everything Core and the panel need to know about the chores. Loot.lua,
-- Vendor.lua, Repair.lua, Camera.lua, Thanks.lua, Fanfare.lua, Errors.lua,
-- Clutter.lua and Destroy.lua hold the behaviour, and Thanks.lua is the only
-- one of them that names anything outside this folder: it asks Unit\Roster.lua
-- whether the player who buffed you is one of yours.
--
-- Settings that have nothing to do with each other sharing one part, because
-- the alternative is a rail entry carrying one tick box each. The panel already
-- has a second level: an ui.Header opens a tab, so the part is one entry in the
-- rail with a tab per chore.
--
-- Clutter is the odd one and has no switch. It is a window you open, it runs
-- nothing in the background, and the tab exists to explain it and to open it. A
-- thing that destroys items does not get to happen while you are not looking.
-- The two numbers it does carry are not a switch either: they are where the
-- money and the level rules get their thresholds, and both are a judgement
-- about the character you are on rather than a rule Clutter.lua could write
-- down for everybody.
--
-- No reset. The registry's reset means "put this part's frames back where they
-- started" and this part has no frames, so registering one would make /wui reset,
-- which is what you type when a window has wandered off screen, quietly turn
-- selling back on for someone who had deliberately turned it off.

-- The two numbers the clutter rules read. Both are steppers rather than a rule
-- written down in Clutter.lua, because both are a judgement about the character
-- you are on: a grey worth eleven copper is clutter at seventy and is a meal at
-- twelve.
