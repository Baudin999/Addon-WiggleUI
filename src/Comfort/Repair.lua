-- same window, behind the same shift key.
--
-- It is one call and not a sweep. RepairAllItems does every slot at once and
-- the server either takes the money or does not, so unlike a sale there is
-- nothing to repeat and no ticker here at all. That is the whole reason this
-- is a separate file from the sale: they share a window and share nothing else.
--
-- Two purses, in a fixed order. Guild funds first when the guild has said you
-- may spend them and this repair fits inside what it has said, then your own.
-- The order is the one every repair addon uses and the one a guild bank with a
-- repair allowance exists for.

-- it is not the client saying the window is drawn. ShowUIPanel defers when
-- another panel holds the slot, and a client that loads MerchantFrame on
-- demand has no frame to ask at all. Either way the repair asked a frame that
-- was not up yet, returned "no merchant window is open", and OnEvent below
-- swallows every refusal, so it failed in silence at every vendor.
--
-- The sale next door never saw it because the sale is a ticker. It asks the
-- same question again a fifth of a second later, by which time the window is
-- up, so one of the two parts on this event worked and the other did not.
--
-- The session is the answer, and its two edges are the two events. Both stay
-- registered whatever the setting says, because this flag is what /wui repair
-- and the panel button read and both of those work with the automatic repair
