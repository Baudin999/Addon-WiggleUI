--

-- quest item, a grey that is not worth its slot, and gear you outgrew. What

-- the answer is yes or no and the queue moves either way.
--
-- The queue is never advanced. It is rebuilt on every press, because the bags
-- move under an open window: something loots, the vendor sweep sells, a stack
-- splits and every slot after it shifts by one. A window holding index 4 of a
-- list it took thirty seconds ago is a window pointing at whatever is in that
-- slot now, and that is the failure this cannot have.
