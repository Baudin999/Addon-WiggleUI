-- What should be up and is not
--
-- Nothing in this addon read your own auras before this file. That is a real
-- hole rather than a missing convenience: a sharpening stone that wore off
-- forty minutes ago costs more damage over a raid than any single rotational
-- mistake, and Battle Shout falling off says nothing at all.
--
-- Two sources, because the client answers two different questions and only one
-- of them is an aura.
--
--   A weapon's temporary enchant is not a buff on you. It does not appear in an
--   aura scan at any index, and GetWeaponEnchantInfo is the only thing in the
--   client that knows about it.
--
--   Everything else is a buff on you and is found by walking your own auras.
--
-- Matching is on the name, never on the id, which is the rule the debuff row on
-- the enemy bars already follows. Battle Shout has eight ranks and the aura on
-- you carries the id of whichever rank was shouted, so an id comparison would
-- go dark the moment you trained the next one. The ids below exist only to ask
-- this client what it calls the spell in the language it is running in, which
-- is what makes the comparison locale independent.
--
-- The walk of your own auras is ns.MyBuffs in Core rather than a loop here. The
-- cooldown row reads the same forty slots off the same event to find out which
-- burst window is open, and one walk answers both.
--
-- The aura scan is event driven and never runs from the ticker. UNIT_AURA fires
-- for every aura you gain and every aura you lose, so a walk of forty slots ten
-- times a second would be four hundred lookups to learn what one event already
-- said. It is worse than that on a client carrying C_UnitAuras, where each slot
-- hands back a freshly built table: that is allocation on a ticker, which is
-- the thing scripts/harness.lua gates and check.sh bans.
--
-- The weapon enchants are the exception and are read on the tick, because a
-- stone that runs out fires nothing. Two values out of one call, no table and
-- no string, which is what makes that affordable.

-- How many entries a class may add. Four, which is more than any class file

-- builds the row's squares once at login off Upkeep.Ceiling. A ceiling that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The two lines
--
-- Every entry stands on one line or on both, and the lines are the whole of
-- when it is asked about. The out line is checked between fights, because a
-- stone and a plate of food are things you put on before the pull and cannot
-- put on during it. The in line is checked during a fight, because a shield
-- that spent its last charge on the third mob and a racial sitting off
-- cooldown are things you fix mid swing or not at all. A shield is both: it
-- should be up before the pull and it is the one that goes down during it.
--
-- So the lines are disjoint sets and an entry is a member of each on its own.
-- Dropping a square on a line puts it there and leaves the other line alone;
-- dragging it off a line takes it off that line only, and off the last line
-- it is switched off, which is where the shelf under the row comes from. The
-- saved word is `out`, `in` or `both`, and absent means what shipped.
--
-- Strings rather than booleans, for the reason Cooldowns.lua gives for its own
-- pair: every reader compares one of them, and a misspelling is then a square
-- on the wrong line rather than a nil error.

-- The three that ship, and whatever your class adds
--
-- Each is here because it is silent when it lapses and expensive while it is
-- lapsed. Nothing that announces itself belongs on this list.
--
-- Two of them are hands rather than auras, and they are the reason this file
-- exists at all. The third is the cheapest buff in the game to keep up and the
-- one most often forgotten after a wipe.
--
-- Nothing on this list is a class ability, and that is the rule. A lapsed
-- sharpening stone costs a hunter's weapon exactly what it costs a warrior's.
-- What your class wants kept up is written in Class/<yours>.lua as `upkeep`,
-- in the same shape as an entry here, and Upkeep.Fixed hands the two back as
-- one list.
--
-- Five fields carry the words, and they are five because they are read in five
-- places that cannot share one string.
--
--   fixed    the caption under the square. It has to fit three others on one
--            line over your character, so it is two or three words and it names
--            what is wrong rather than where. "main hand" named the slot and
--            left you to work out what about it, which on a bare icon is no
--            help at all. "bare weapon" is the voice the racial half already
--            speaks in with "press Blood Fury": it says the thing you would fix.
--   word     what you type. `/wui buffs weapon off`.
--   switch   the panel's tick box, which is a sentence rather than a label
--            because every other tick box on that page is one.
--   hint     the tooltip, which is where the detail the caption cannot hold
--            goes: what the square is about and what fixes it.
--
-- An entry names one aura with `spell` or a set of them with `spells`, and a
-- set means any one of them counts. That is what a mage's armour is: four
-- spells, one of which should always be up, and nagging about the particular
-- one they are not running would be nagging about a choice.
--
-- The slash words name the thing rather than the slot, with one deliberate
-- exception. `weapon`, `shout` and `food` are the things. `offhand` is the hand,
-- because for that entry the hand is the thing: the whole rule on it is that a
-- shield in that hand is never nagged about and a weapon in it is, so the hand
-- is what you are switching off rather than an address for something else.

-- The weapon enchants

--
-- Nothing on this machine settles which of the three 2.5.6 and 1.15.9 answer
-- with. The one unguarded call in this install is inside a Details library
-- written against a much later client and reads the eight value shape, and the
-- language server stub beside it disagrees with itself twice.
--
-- So it is counted rather than assumed. select("#", f()) is the exact number of
-- values the client returned, whatever they are, and the only thing this file
-- needs from it is the stride between the two hands: three on the old shape and
-- four on either newer one.
--
-- Reading it positionally on a guess is the failure worth avoiding. At stride
-- three against a client that answers eight, the off hand's "has an enchant"
-- would be read out of the main hand's enchant id, which is a number, which is
-- truthy, which is a nag that never fires and never says why.
