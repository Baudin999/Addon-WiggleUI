-- The row
--
-- A row of squares that appears when something is wrong and is not there at all
-- when nothing is. That is the whole design decision and it is worth stating,
-- because the other option was a row that is always up with the missing ones
-- lit.
--
-- A row that is always there is furniture. You stop seeing furniture in about a
-- week, which is exactly long enough to convince yourself the addon is watching
-- for you. A row that is only there when something is wrong carries its whole
-- message in existing: if you can see squares, go fix something, and there is
-- nothing to read when there is nothing to do.
--
-- The cost of that choice is that an empty row is a frame you cannot find to
-- drag. So unlocking shows every square this row would ever draw, at three
-- quarters alpha, which is the same trade Meter/Window.lua makes when it draws
-- an outline and a title around a pane that has no rows in it.
--
-- Two lines, taking turns rather than sharing. Out of combat the row is the out
-- line: what is missing that you put on before a pull, no stone, no shout, no
-- food. In combat it is the in line: the racial you own and have not pressed,
-- and whatever you dragged there because it lapses mid fight, a shaman's shield
-- being the one the feature was asked for. An entry can stand on both, and a
-- shield does. They cannot both be on screen, so the row is never longer than
-- the shorter question, and each line means one thing. Upkeep.lua holds the
-- lines and says which entry stands on which.
--
-- A square is a button as well as a picture. Clicking one opens the options
-- window on the page the row is set up on, because the square is the one thing
-- on screen you are certain to be looking at when you decide a nag is wrong,
-- and the page it is switched off on is nine groups away.
--
-- Built out of UI/Ability.lua rather than out of textures. That file already
-- draws a square with a cropped icon, a hairline that carries a status, a
-- cooldown swipe and a timer, and it already guards every write it makes
-- against the value on the widget. A second square-drawing thing in this addon
-- would be the third copy of the same six writes, which is what UI/Ability.lua
-- was extracted to stop.

-- between. Meter/Window.lua carries the same number for the same reason.
local ICON = 27
local GAP = 4          -- one square to the next
-- The line under the row, in pixels, and at the outline floor because it is

-- means, and a square with nothing to say is not drawn at all. The other five
-- keys are here because Ability.Look takes a whole palette and a table missing
-- one would be a nil index on a tick rather than a wrong colour.
--
-- Red in both, because red is one sentence said twice: you are doing something
-- wrong. What differs is the art. A missing buff is drained, because the art is
-- a picture of a thing that is not on you. An unpressed racial is at full
-- colour, because the ability is there and ready and the only thing missing is
-- your thumb.

-- How loud, and why there is no sound
--
-- The brief for this feature was that you should feel bad about not pressing
-- Blood Fury, which is a request for something you cannot ignore rather than
-- for a grey square in a corner. Nothing in this addon flashes or makes a noise
-- today, so adding either is a new kind of thing here and has to be argued for
-- rather than dropped in.
--
-- What it does: the racial square breathes. Its alpha runs between a floor and
-- full over 1.6 seconds and back, which at the ticker's ten hertz is sixteen
-- steps and reads as a pulse rather than a strobe. It is on by default, because
-- a nag you can ignore is not the feature that was asked for, and `buffs pulse
-- off` turns it into a still square for anyone who disagrees.
--
-- What it does not do: play a sound. A sound in a raid competes with the sounds
-- you are already listening for, it fires whether or not you are looking at the
-- screen, and it is the one kind of interface element you cannot glance past.
-- Blood Fury coming off cooldown is not an emergency; it is a fact you would
-- like to notice within a few seconds. A pulsing icon in the middle of the
-- screen is exactly the right volume for that and a chime is not.
--
-- The alpha is quantised to twentieths on purpose. Every ticker in this addon
-- compares before it writes, and a continuous curve would write a new alpha on
-- every tick forever, including the ticks where the change is invisible.

-- What one square says to the mouse
--
-- The caption has to fit four squares' worth of words on one line over your
-- character, so it says "bare weapon" and stops. That is the right length for a
-- thing you read at a glance mid-raid and it is not enough to act on if you
-- have never seen the row before. The tooltip is where the rest goes: what the
-- square is about, what fixes it, and the name of the switch that silences it,
-- so somebody tired of one square can turn it off from the square rather than
-- reading the whole panel looking for it.
--
-- Buttons/Square.lua owns this shape for the action bars and this follows it.
-- OnEnter and OnLeave, anchored to the square, and refused outright when there
-- is nothing to say rather than left to fill itself in from whatever the
-- tooltip was last handed, which would leave the previous square's sentence on
-- screen pointing at this one. It is not shared with that file: every step
-- there is about an action slot read off a secure button's attribute and handed
-- to the client to describe, and none of the three has anything to do with a
-- sharpening stone.
--
-- A square takes the mouse only while the row is locked and drawn, which is two
-- decisions.
--
-- Drawn, because six of the ten squares are hidden at any moment and enabling
-- the mouse on all ten at login would leave invisible mouse traps sitting over
-- the middle of the screen.
--
-- Locked, because unlocked the row is a thing you drag. The parent frame owns
-- that drag, and a square on top of it taking the mouse would eat the button
-- before the drag started. That is the same trap Nag.Lock carries a note about
-- one level up, met again one level down.
--
-- The row sits above the middle of the screen, which is exactly where a right
-- button drag to turn the camera starts. ns.Tip.Hang hands those buttons back
-- where the client will take them and says what it costs where it will not.
--
-- The three lines below are what this file used to write by hand into the
-- client's own tooltip, and the shape of them is now UI/Tip.lua's: a title, a line that
-- says what is wrong, and a hint that says what to type. It is handed over as
-- one subject rather than written a call at a time, so what a square says is a
-- value this file returns rather than a sequence it has to perform. The tooltip
-- that draws it is the addon's own, so hovering a nag square no longer raises a
-- parchment scroll over an interface that has none anywhere else.
--
-- What the square names, which is the last thing that made this box read unlike
-- every other one.
--
-- An action square hands UI/Tip.lua its slot, an aura hands it a unit and an
-- index, and both get the client's own words at the top with the addon's
-- underneath. A nag square handed over `note`, which reads nothing, so its head
-- was "food" in the caption's voice while the box eight pixels away had a spell
-- name, a rank and a cast time. The reason was real: there is no aura index for
-- an aura that is not on you.
--
-- There is still a handle on all three shapes, and Subject picks the one that
-- fits. A racial or a watched buff is an id, which UI/Scan.lua now takes. A
-- bare hand is a worn slot, which it always took, and the weapon's own tooltip
-- is the right thing to read for a square whose whole complaint is what is not
-- on that weapon. Only an entry with neither is left saying `note`.
--
-- The title goes along regardless. UI/Tooltip.lua draws the client's lines
-- instead of a title where there are any and the title where there are none, so
-- the caption's phrase is what an older client and an empty slot fall back to
-- rather than a second heading nobody sees.
