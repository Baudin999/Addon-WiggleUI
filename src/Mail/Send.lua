-- Getting the letter out
--
-- Mail/Draft.lua says what is being sent and how many mails that divides into.
-- This is the conversation with the server: fill the client's own form, send
-- it, wait for the server to say it went, fill it again.
--
-- **Why it is a state machine and not a loop.** A mail is not sent when
-- SendMail returns. The attachments leave your bags, the server thinks about
-- it, and MAIL_SEND_SUCCESS arrives some time later with the form now empty. A
-- loop that filled the form three times in one frame would put thirty six items
-- into twelve slots and lose twenty four of them. So there is exactly one mail
-- in flight and the next one starts when the server has finished with the last.
--
-- **How an item gets onto the form.** UseContainerItem, with the send pane
-- flagged as showing. That is the same call that sells a grey at a merchant and
-- eats a bread roll anywhere else, and the flag is what decides which: this is
-- the shape Baganator/Transfers/AddToMail.lua uses on this exact client, and
-- SetSendMailShowing is what it sets first.
--
-- The pick-up-and-click route is the other way to do it, and it is worse here.
-- It puts an item on the cursor, which means a failure halfway leaves the
-- player holding a stack of ore in the middle of a window, and it needs the
-- attachment slot chosen by hand. UseContainerItem picks the first free slot
-- itself and never touches the cursor.
--
-- **Every slot is resolved again at send.** Draft holds a link and the bag slot
-- it was dropped from, and both are checked before anything moves: the slot has
-- to still hold that same link, and if it does not the bags are rescanned for
-- one that does. An item that has genuinely gone is counted and reported rather
-- than silently replaced by whatever is in that slot now, which is the failure
-- Comfort/Destroy.lua is built around and is worse here.
--
-- **There is no timeout and that is deliberate.** A stalled send waits, the
-- window says which mail of how many it is waiting on, and there is a stop
-- button under it. The alternative is an OnUpdate, and an OnUpdate is a ticker
-- this addon would then have to defend forever, for a case that is a server not
-- answering. MAIL_FAILED and the mailbox closing both end it on their own.
