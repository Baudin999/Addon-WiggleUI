-- Right click in the bags, onto the letter
--
-- The client's own mail window has this and it is the only way anybody actually
-- attaches anything: you right click the stack and it goes. Dragging twelve
-- items onto a block one at a time is not a thing a person does twice.
--
-- **The right button is taken off the square, not off the client.** A bag
-- button's OnClick is the template's own and it is secure, which is the only
-- reason a right click on a scroll reads it: `C_Container.UseContainerItem` is
-- protected and refuses insecure code. The handler resolves
-- `ContainerFrameItemButton_OnClick` by name on every click, so this file used
-- to take that name over while the window was open and hand it back when it
-- closed. That was the bug. A global written by an addon is tainted, and it
-- stays tainted when the value written back is the client's own function, so
-- one visit to a mailbox left every right click in the bags refused for the
-- rest of the session. Nothing here writes a global any more.
--
-- What a square answers to is a widget setting rather than a Lua value, and
-- writing it taints nothing. So while the window is open every square in this
-- addon's bag window is registered for the left button alone, which keeps the
-- secure OnClick off the right one, and an OnMouseUp of this file's takes the
-- right button instead. The window closes and both go back. The OnClick itself
-- is never set, read or replaced, and the client's own handler runs as secure
-- as it was built.
--
-- **Only this addon's squares.** The old takeover reached Blizzard's bags and
-- Baganator's through the shared name; a widget setting reaches the widgets it
-- is set on. This addon draws the bag window, so those are the squares under
-- the pointer. A square built while the window is open arrives through
-- Bags.Dress from Bags/Grid.lua, already holding the right state.
--
-- **A click this file claims is never passed on.** Not when the list is full,
-- not when the stack is already on the mail, not while a send is in flight. A
-- refusal says why and stops there. A bare right click on a square this file
-- does not want, an empty slot, does nothing: the client's own answer would go
-- through the protected call, and from here that call is refused. There is
-- nothing in an empty slot to use.
--
-- **Only a bare right click.** Shift is the client's stack split, ctrl is its
-- dress-up, and a modified right click is handed to the client's own modified
-- click handler by name. None of what that does is protected, so it can be
-- called from here. The left button is untouched, so picking a stack up and
-- dropping it on the block still works and is still the way to attach
-- something out of the bank.
