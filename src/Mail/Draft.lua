--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The letter you are writing
--
-- A recipient, a subject, a body, some coin and a list of things out of your
-- bags. Nothing here draws and nothing here talks to the server: this is what
-- the window edits and what Mail/Send.lua walks, and keeping the two apart is
-- what lets one mail of twelve items and three mails of twelve be the same
-- object with a different length.
--
-- **Twelve is the client's number, not ours.** A mail carries twelve
-- attachments and there is no argument to be had with that. What the client
-- then does is make twelve the number *you* have to think in: you fill a form,
-- send it, walk back to the bag, fill it again. So the list here has no such
-- limit and Draft.Mails divides. Thirty six is the cap, which is three mails
-- and about as much as anybody moves in one go; past that the postage is
-- noticeable and you would want to know rather than find out.
--
-- **An attachment is a link, not a bag slot.** The bags move while a window is
-- open: something loots, a stack splits, the vendor sweep sells and every slot
-- after it shifts by one. A list of slot numbers taken thirty seconds ago is a
-- list pointing at whatever is in those slots now, which is the failure the
-- clutter window is built around and is worse here, because the wrong item goes
-- to somebody else's mailbox rather than to nowhere. So a slot is resolved
-- twice: once when you drop, to say what you dropped, and again at send, by
-- Mail/Send.lua, against the link this recorded.
--
-- There are two ways on and they differ in what they know. A right click in the
-- bags landed on one square and names it, which is Draft.AttachSlot; a drop
-- carries an item and no slot at all, so Draft.Attach has to go looking for the
-- first stack of it that is not already spoken for. The click is the exact one
-- and the drop is the one that has to guess, which is why the third stack of
-- ore you point at is the third stack that goes.
--
-- **The subject writes itself.** Sending gold titles the mail "money" and
-- sending one thing titles it after that thing, because that is what you would
-- have typed and because an inbox of mails called nothing is an inbox you have
-- to open one at a time. A subject you type wins over both, always; a split
-- send numbers the parts so three mails that arrive together can be told apart.
--
-- **What "risky" means.** Value on the mail and a recipient who is not on your
-- favourites list. Not "a stranger": a guild bank alt you mail every week is a
-- stranger by relation and is exactly who you meant, and an alt the addon knows
-- about but you have never mailed is not. The list is the thing you curated, so
-- the list is what the warning is measured against. Mail/Window.lua is what
-- draws the warning and what makes you press twice.
