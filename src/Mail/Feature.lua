--
-- Two of those names are the whole reason this file is more than a registration.
-- Mail/Who.lua answers what a recipient is and deliberately holds no list of
-- its own for two of the three answers, because both lists already exist in
-- other parts: the characters on your account are Feeds/Purse.lua's ledger, and
-- the people who matter to you are Chat/People.lua's groups. Copying either one
-- would be a second list to keep in step, so the tests are registered here and
-- Who.lua never learns the name of either file.
