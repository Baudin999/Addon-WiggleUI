-- What made a frame take that long
--
-- The recorder next door knows a frame took 118 ms. This file is the half that
-- can say why, and the honest answer has four shapes and no more:
--
--   Lua, and whose      GetScriptCPUUsage is a running total of every
--                       millisecond the client has spent inside Lua. Read once
--                       a frame, its difference is that frame's Lua time
--                       exactly. Which addon spent it is a second question,
--                       answered a second at a time rather than a frame at a
--                       time, because naming it means walking every addon the
--                       client has loaded and that walk is not free.
--   the collector       Lua's own, which runs when it likes. A fall in
--                       collectgarbage("count") across one frame is a
--                       collection and nothing else is.
--   an event storm      four hundred combat log lines arriving between two
--                       frames is a stall whether or not any one handler is
--                       slow. Perf/Census.lua counts them.
--   the client itself   a frame with no Lua in it, no collection and no events
--                       went on drawing, streaming a texture off the disk, or
--                       compiling a shader. No addon can see any of that, and
--                       saying so is worth more than guessing.
--
-- **Three of the four need scriptProfile, which is a CVar and a reload.** With
-- it off, the client answers nothing about Lua time at all: this addon still
-- knows what its own tickers cost, because it times them itself, but the
-- ninety milliseconds some other addon spent are invisible and no amount of
-- code here changes that. The switch is offered on the page and turned nowhere
-- else. It slows the whole client for as long as it is on, which is the reason
-- it ships off and the reason nothing here turns it on quietly.

-- and what it answers is a constant 0, which is a number and passes every other
-- test here. Perf/Trace.lua read that as a real zero, latched minute.profiled
-- on it, and wrote 0.00 into the log's lua column where the contract says -1.
-- Three hours of rows said the profiler was on and the client had spent no time
-- in Lua, which is the one shape a reader cannot tell from a measurement. Ask

-- profiler off now costs a CVar lookup here rather than a call into it.
