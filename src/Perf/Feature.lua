-- The tab. Perf.lua holds the numbers and knows the name of no part; this file
-- is the only one that knows both, which is the same seam every other part
-- draws between its behaviour and its Feature.
--
-- The rows do not go through ns.Options.Refresh. That walks every row on every
-- page and re-measures the ones that wrap, which is the right thing when a
-- setting changed and the wrong thing once a second forever. These rows are
-- fixed height and single line by construction, so the sampler writes their
-- strings directly and nothing is laid out again.

-- hz is what the row's ticker runs at, and it is what turns a per tick figure
-- into the share of a second the part actually takes. The swing timer has no
-- rate of its own: it draws on every frame, because motion is drawn on the
-- frame the screen is drawn on or it is drawn in steps. The enemy cast fills
-- are the second thing in the addon to say so and the second row with no hertz.
-- Both are costed against 60 frames a second, which is the same budget Total
-- below measures everything against, and `rate` is what the heading says
-- instead of a number of hertz.
--
-- Three parts have two rows now, because three parts are told rather than
-- asked: a fast pass over what the client said moved, and a slower reading of
-- everything for what no event carries. The enemy bars are "enemy cast fills"
-- and "enemy bars"; the other two say which half they are. A row's hertz is the
-- ticker's own interval and has to be moved with it, or the tab reports a share
-- of a second that is five times what the part actually takes.
