-- Ctrl-R
--
-- The key the client already puts a frame rate on, taken for a window that
-- says rather more.
--
-- **This is a key taken off Blizzard, and that is the argument for it.** The
-- dungeon log asks for a key of its own because there is no adventure guide on
-- these clients to replace. Here there is something to replace: TOGGLEFPS draws
-- one averaged number in a corner, an average is the one figure that cannot
-- show a stutter, and the muscle memory for "how is this machine doing" is
-- already on Ctrl-R. Putting the answer somewhere else would leave the worse
-- answer on the key everyone reaches for.
--
-- **An override binding, never a real one.** SetBindingClick writes into the
-- live binding set and the next SaveBindings, which the client's own Key
-- Bindings panel calls when you press Okay, would make that permanent. An
-- override sits on top of the set: TOGGLEFPS is shadowed while this holds the
-- key and comes straight back the moment the switch goes off or the key is
-- rebound. Nothing in a binding file is touched. It is the same mechanism
-- Dungeons/Key.lua, Charge/Icon.lua and Targeting/Switch.lua all use, and the
-- displaced binding is kept for the same reason: the panel can say what is
-- being shadowed rather than the player finding out.
--
-- **The button is not secure and does not need to be.** Opening a window is
-- ordinary Lua, so the key works in combat, which for a window you open to find
-- out why a pull stuttered is the whole point of it.
