-- What the addon costs
--
-- GetAddOnMemoryUsage answers one number for the whole addon, and one number
-- for the whole addon is close to useless: "WarriorKit, 341 KB" names nothing
-- you can switch off. What is worth measuring is the four tickers, because each
-- one maps to a setting on the page next to this one.
--
-- So the tickers time themselves. debugprofilestop is a millisecond clock with
-- a fractional part, two calls per tick bracket a tick body, and forty ticks a
-- second across the whole addon makes that free by any measure that matters.
-- The tab reports what it costs anyway, because a performance tab that will not
-- account for itself is asking to be believed rather than read.
--
-- Memory is the other half and it is not free. UpdateAddOnMemoryUsage walks
-- every addon the client has loaded, so it runs at 1 Hz and only while the tab
-- is actually on screen. Nothing samples memory when you are not looking at it.
--
-- Two things this cannot see, both written into the tab rather than only here.
-- The client attributes Lua allocation to an addon and nothing else, so frames
-- and textures, which live on the C side and are most of what a UI addon really
-- costs, never appear in the figure. And per-addon CPU through GetAddOnCPUUsage
-- needs the scriptProfile CVar and a reload, and it slows the whole client while
-- it is on. TitanPerformance owns that CVar in this install. This file reads the
-- number when someone else has turned it on and never turns it on itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Ring of recent samples per slot, so a spike is visible rather than averaged
-- away. Sized once at load and written in place forever after: an allocation on
-- a measuring path would be measuring itself.
local WINDOW = 64
local SAMPLE_RATE = 1.0

-- Declared here, in the order they are shown, because a table built per frame is
-- the thing this file exists to catch.
-- "cast" and "playercast" are the two that run on every frame beside the swing
-- bars. The first of them was named by UnitFrames/EnemyBars.lua and by the
-- performance tab and was missing from this list, so the row for it read as
-- unavailable for the whole life of the enemy cast row: Perf.Start finds no
-- slot for a key that is not here and returns without doing anything.
-- "castsweep" is the other half of "playercast". The two were one handler timed
-- as one number, and splitting the poll from the per-frame fill split the
-- measurement with it rather than reporting a fifth-of-a-second poll as
-- something that happens sixty times a second.
-- "feed" is the third that runs on every frame, and it is the cheapest of the
-- three by design: it reads one field and draws only on the frames a line
-- arrived on. Named here so the tab can say what that costs during a pull,
-- which is the question the change that put it on a tick was answering.
--
-- "skinread" and "partyread" are the other halves of "skin" and "party". Both
-- parts were one number when both were a poll; each is now a fast pass over
-- what the client said moved and a slower reading of everything, and timing the
-- pair as one would report a once-a-second reading as something that happens
-- five times a second.
--
-- Ten more of them were missing the same way, and two of those run on every
-- frame: the tooltip's own sweep and the chart's drift. A ticker whose name is
-- not here is not timed at all and its row on the tab reads as unavailable, so
-- the two most expensive shapes a tick can have were invisible on the tab
-- written to find them. scripts/check.sh compares this list against every
-- ns.UI.Ticker call in the addon now, in both directions.

	"hush",
	"vendor", "thanks", "sampler", "feed", "adhoc",
	-- Every tween in the addon, on one tick that stops itself when nothing is
	-- moving. One slot rather than one per animation: a caller arms a tween, it
	-- does not arm a ticker, so what a reader wants on the tab is what movement
	-- costs in total on the frames there is any.
	"anim",
	-- Every number in the air, on one tick that stops itself when nothing is
	-- falling, and the watch that says a word above your head. Two slots rather
	-- than one because they answer different questions: the first is what a
	-- busy pull costs to draw and the second is a poll that runs only in a
	-- fight and only on a class with something to announce.
	"numbers", "calls",
	-- The three the frame trace is made of. "frame" is the recorder itself,
	-- which runs on every frame and is the one tick in the addon whose cost has
	-- to be subtracted from what it reports. "hud" is the window painting
	-- itself, ten times a second and only while it is open. "census" is not a
	-- ticker: Perf/Census.lua brackets its own OnEvent by a literal name, the
	-- way the bag window does, because a handler the client calls on every
	-- event in the game is the one cost on this list nobody can guess at.
	"frame", "hud", "census",
	-- The character sheet's figure, turning under a drag. Every frame while the
	-- button is down and nothing at all otherwise, which is the one tick on this
	-- list a player arms on purpose and can stop by letting go.
	"figure",
	-- The stone, the oil or the poison on a hand, counting down on the three
	-- weapon rows of the same page. Once a second and it walks three rows, and
	-- on all but one second a minute it finds the same whole number it left and
	-- writes nothing.
	"oil",
	-- The trinkets on that same page, sweeping. Four times a second while the
	-- sheet is open and something on it is a thing you press, and stopped
	-- otherwise, which on a character wearing nothing with a use on it is
	-- always. It walks the squares the repaint found rather than all nineteen.
	"trinket",
	-- A frame the theme reveals on hover, asking whether the pointer is still
	-- on it. Five times a second, and only while the pointer is over one of
	-- that frame's own buttons; it stops itself when the pointer leaves.
	"reveal",
	-- The one slot that is not a ticker. Bags/Window.lua brackets its refresh,
	-- which the bag events book up to ten times a second at a vendor, and
	-- scripts/check.sh reads a literal ns.Perf.Start as a slot for that reason.

--
