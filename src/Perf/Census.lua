-- Every event the client sends, counted
--
-- One frame registered for all of them, a counter per name, and two questions
-- answered off it: how many events landed in the frame that just went past, and
-- which name most of them carried. A frame that took 90 ms with four hundred
-- events in it has explained itself, and nothing else in the client will say so.
--
-- **This is the only part of the addon that registers for events it does not
-- read.** RegisterAllEvents means the client makes a Lua call here for every
-- event in the game, which in a raid is over a thousand a second. That is a
-- real cost and it is why this is switched on with the frame trace rather than
-- at login: the handler is four lines, it allocates nothing, and it brackets
-- itself under the "census" slot so the performance tab reports what counting
-- costs beside everything else it measures.
--
-- **The combat log is not counted here.** It is the loudest event in the game
-- and the one that most often fills a frame, so leaving it out would gut the
-- census, but Core/CombatLog.lua's whole argument is that this addon registers
-- for it exactly once and gives the event back when no part is reading. A
-- second registration would be that debt wearing a different name. So that file
-- counts its own lines, one increment on a path it already owns, and
-- Perf/Trace.lua folds the difference in per frame. This file skips the name
-- whether or not the client hands it over, which is what stops it being counted
-- twice on a client where RegisterAllEvents does deliver it.
--
-- **Nothing is zeroed per frame.** A walk over every name the session has seen,
-- sixty times a second, is the shape this file exists to catch. Each name
-- carries the frame it was last counted in instead, so a count from an older
-- frame reads as zero and is overwritten rather than cleared.

-- counted 6000 a minute in a minute with nothing happening in it, which is one
-- a frame. An event on every frame runs every handler registered for it on
-- every frame, outside any ticker bracket, and that is the shape the garbage
-- this addon cannot account for would have.
--
-- A walk over every name seen, which is why it is once a minute. `minuted` is
-- the lifetime count at the last asking, so the difference is the minute.
