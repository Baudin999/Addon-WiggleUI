-- The window Ctrl-R opens
--
-- The client's own Ctrl-R draws a number in a corner. This draws the last four
-- seconds of frames as a strip, what the last second went on underneath it, and
-- a log of the frames that went wrong with a sentence each saying why.
--
-- **The strip is the point and the number is not.** A frame rate is an average
-- over a second, and the thing you felt was one frame inside that second. Sixty
-- frames with a 200 ms stall in them still read as 55 fps, which is why the
-- client's own display can be up while the game stutters and say nothing at
-- all. One column per frame cannot hide a stall: the column is as tall as the
-- frame was.
--
-- **It is drawn as a ring, not a scroll.** The oldest column is overwritten by
-- the newest and a cursor marks where the writing head is, the way an
-- oscilloscope sweeps. Scrolling would mean rewriting two hundred and forty
-- heights on every repaint to move a picture sideways; this rewrites the
-- handful that changed. The cost of a window about performance is not a detail.
--
-- **Every string is built behind a comparison.** The two fillers below carry a
-- cold marker because that is exactly what they are: the tick compares the
-- numbers, and the functions that turn numbers into words run on the tick where
-- one of them moved. A window that rebuilt thirty strings ten times a second
-- would be the most expensive thing on its own list.
